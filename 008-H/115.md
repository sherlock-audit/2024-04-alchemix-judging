# Hardcoded swap path might cause DOS to the rewards distribution

## Summary
The router paths inside the `claimAndDonateRewards` function are hardcoded which might cause DOS to the rewards distribution.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function `claimAndDonateRewards` employs predetermined swap paths, namely `OP → USDC → alUSD` and `OP → WETH → alETH`, to convert debtTokens. The determination of the `minimumAmountOut` relies on a chainlink price oracle. Consequently, if the resulting `amountOut` from the swap falls below the specified `minimumAmountOut`, the transaction will be reverted. A potential vulnerability arises from the hardcoded nature of these paths, as it increases susceptibility to low liquidity scenarios within the respective pools. For instance, insufficient liquidity in the `OP/USDC` or `OP/WETH` pool may lead to transaction failures due to slippage. Such occurrences could consequently disrupt the rewards distribution mechanism, potentially constituting a denial-of-service (DoS) threat.
## Impact
Rewards distribution can be DOS ed
