# Non-Compliance with xERC20 Standard in `AlchemicTokenV2Base`

## Summary

The `AlchemicTokenV2Base` fails to meet xERC20 compliance as stated in the contestâ€™s readme. It lacks correct implementation of certain xERC20 standard functionalities.

## Vulnerability Detail

in xerc20 standard it says that `burn` should only be called by a bridge:

- [xerc20standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/7281/commits/73f71763a3f3b0ac570cd4d47ae87b3c1504f3c8#diff-c231bb5c1af427a475af5771fa071a0f48ac8e058c6f9d36e5ab86f2c096ea6d)
```solidity
/**
   * @notice Burns tokens for a user
   * @dev Can only be called by a bridge
   * @param _user The address of the user who needs tokens burned
   * @param _amount The amount of tokens being burned
   */

  function burn(address _user, uint256 _amount) external;
}
```

while the `burn` and `burnSelf` function of `AlchemicTokenV2Base` has no accessControl so anybody can call it:

```solidity=190
function burn(address account, uint256 amount) external {
```

in contrary to `mint` which has access control of onlyWhitelisted, which means only bridges can call it.

## Impact

not compliant with xerc20

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

make `burn` and `burnSelf` with the `onlyWhitelisted` modifier to make only canonical bridge able to call it to be xerc20 compliant.

```diff=175
-function burnSelf(uint256 amount) external {
+function burnSelf(uint256 amount) external onlyWhitelisted{
```

```diff=190
-function burn(address account, uint256 amount) external {
+function burn(address account, uint256 amount) external onlyWhitelisted{
```
