# Deployments to L2 networks should check for active sequencer for Chainlink feeds

## Summary

As mentioned in the protocol's Q&A for the contest: "Optimism and Arbitrum are currently live. Future plans include Layer 2 chains such as Metis, Linea, and Base". As of right now protocol's current usage of Chainlink price feeds doesn't consider whether the sequencer is down for deployments on L2 blockchains. It's important to ensure that the prices provided are not falsely perceived as fresh, even when the sequencer is down. It should be always checked before consuming any data from Chainlink.

## Vulnerability Detail

There is no check if the sequencer is down:

```javascript
function getExpectedExchange(address yieldToken) external view returns (uint256) {
        .
        .
        .
        // Ensure that round is complete, otherwise price is stale.
        (
            uint80 roundID,
            int256 opToUsd,
            ,
            uint256 updateTime,
            uint80 answeredInRound
        ) = IChainlinkOracle(opToUsdOracle).latestRoundData();
        
        require(
            opToUsd > 0, 
            "Chainlink Malfunction"
        );

        if( updateTime < block.timestamp - 1200 seconds ) {
            revert("Chainlink Malfunction");
        }

        // Ensure that round is complete, otherwise price is stale.
        (
            uint80 roundIDEth,
            int256 ethToUsd,
            ,
            uint256 updateTimeEth,
            uint80 answeredInRoundEth
        ) = IChainlinkOracle(ethToUsdOracle).latestRoundData();
        
        require(
            ethToUsd > 0, 
            "Chainlink Malfunction"
        );

        if( updateTimeEth < block.timestamp - 1200 seconds ) {
            revert("Chainlink Malfunction");
        }
        .
        .
        .
```

## Impact

The reward collector is attempting to claim, but the sequencer is down, and this results in stale/invalid values given to be claimed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement functionality to check the sequencer uptime with Chainlink oracles for deploying to L2s.
