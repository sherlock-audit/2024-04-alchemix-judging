# Oracle's validation checks can be further strengthened

## Summary

Validation checks of the oracle can be further strengthened.

## Vulnerability Detail

Following is the existing validation check in place for the returned oracle price.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-alchemix/blob/main/v2-foundry/src/utils/collectors/OptimismRewardCollector.sol#L78

```solidity
File: OptimismRewardCollector.sol
091:     function getExpectedExchange(address yieldToken) external view returns (uint256) {
092:         uint256 expectedExchange;
093:         address[] memory token = new address[](1);
094:         uint256 totalToSwap = TokenUtils.safeBalanceOf(rewardToken, address(this));
095: 
096:         // Ensure that round is complete, otherwise price is stale.
097:         (
098:             uint80 roundID,
099:             int256 opToUsd,
100:             ,
101:             uint256 updateTime,
102:             uint80 answeredInRound
103:         ) = IChainlinkOracle(opToUsdOracle).latestRoundData();
104:         
105:         require(
106:             opToUsd > 0, 
107:             "Chainlink Malfunction"
108:         );
109: 
110:         if( updateTime < block.timestamp - 1200 seconds ) {
111:             revert("Chainlink Malfunction");
112:         }
```

It was observed that the validation checks can be further strengthened. Refer to the recommendation for more details.

## Impact

Oracle price returned might be incorrect under certain conditions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider implementing the following check against the returned oracle price.

```solidity
if (
    roundID == 0 || opToUsd <= 0 || updateTime == 0 || updateTime > block.timestamp
        || updateTime < block.timestamp - 1200
) revert InvalidDataReturned();
```

The [L2 Sequencer Uptime Feeds](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds) were also not utilized to check the status of the L2 sequencer in the price oracle. Consider integrating it into the oracle if necessary.
