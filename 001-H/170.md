# No check for active L2 Sequencer

## Summary
Using Chainlink in L2 chains such as Arbitrum requires to check if the sequencer is down to avoid prices from looking like they are fresh although they are not according to their [recommendation](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#arbitrum)

## Vulnerability Detail
`OptimismRewardCollector::getExpectedExchange` calls for prices from chainlink oracle, given that the OptimismRewardCollector is deployed on L2 this will cause the prices to looking like they are fresh even when they are not, thus providing wrong feed to the `RewardRouter` and disrupting its `distributeRewards` as it calls `IRewardCollector(rewards[vault].rewardCollectorAddress).getExpectedExchange(vault)` to distribute rewards.

```solidity
 (
            uint80 roundID,
            int256 opToUsd,

            ,
            uint256 updateTime,
            uint80 answeredInRound
        ) = IChainlinkOracle(opToUsdOracle).latestRoundData();
        
        require(
            opToUsd > 0, 
            "Chainlink Malfunction"
        );
        if( updateTime < block.timestamp - 1200 seconds ) {
            revert("Chainlink Malfunction");
        }

    // @audit : add check for sequencer uptime.
/**
 example:

        bool isSequencerUp = answer == 0;
        if (!isSequencerUp) {
            revert SequencerDown();
        }

        // Make sure the grace period has passed after the
        // sequencer is back up.
        uint256 timeSinceUp = block.timestamp - startedAt;
        if (timeSinceUp <= GRACE_PERIOD_TIME) {
            revert GracePeriodNotOver();
        }

```
this issue was also raised in one of the audits for notional finance:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-notional-judging/issues/2

They have similar implementation, they had also implemented the freshnes check as it is implemented in OptimismRewardCollector. 

Their implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-notional/blob/7aadd254da5f645a7e1b718e7f9128f845e10f02/leveraged-vaults/contracts/trading/TradingModule.sol#L249-L251)

In alchemix's scenario too this issue persists given that the Arbitrum is mentioned in the readme and the router owners are restricted.

According to sponsors also, if sequencer downtime can cause any issues apart from simply transaction not going through, it might be worth considering.

## Impact
If the sequencer goes down, the protocol will allow users to continue to operate at the previous (stale) rates and this can be leveraged by malicious actors to gain unfair advantage.
