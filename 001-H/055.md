# Oracle prices are missing checks in the function `OptimismRewardCollector::getExpectedExchange`

## Summary

The function `OptimismRewardCollector::getExpectedExchange` function lacks several checks in the handling of oracle data from Chainlink which can create several vulnerabilities. 
These include not checking if the sequencer is up and not ensuring the price is within a specified range.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. The function does note check if the sequencer is up and that the "Grace Period" has passed. If the Arbitrum/Optimism Sequencer goes down, oracle data will not be kept up to date, and thus could become stale.
  

2. The function also lacks validation to ensure the fetched price falls within predefined minimum and maximum bounds. In times of extreme volatility, the function will start consuming stale prices.

Consider also implementing Chainlink's recommanded check for the roundId.

## Impact

The lack of proper validation and checks can result in the function operating with outdated or incorrect price data, leading to financial decisions based on inaccurate information.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider implementing the following checks :

```js
function isSequencerActive() internal view returns (bool) {
        (, int256 answer, uint256 startedAt,,) = sequencer.latestRoundData();
        if (block.timestamp - startedAt <= GRACE_PERIOD_TIME || answer == 1)
            return false;
        return true;
    }
```
```js
        // Ensure that round is complete, otherwise price is stale.
        (uint80 roundID, int256 opToUsd,, uint256 updateTime, uint80 answeredInRound) =
            IChainlinkOracle(opToUsdOracle).latestRoundData();

        require(opToUsd > 0, "Chainlink Malfunction");

        if (updateTime < block.timestamp - 1200 seconds) {
            revert("Chainlink Malfunction");
        }
       require(isSequencerActive(), "Sequencer is down");
       require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Stale price");
       require(opToUsd< _maxPrice, "Upper price bound breached");
       require(opToUsd> _minPrice, "Lower price bound breached");
```

```js
       // Ensure that round is complete, otherwise price is stale.
        (uint80 roundIDEth, int256 ethToUsd,, uint256 updateTimeEth, uint80 answeredInRoundEth) =
            IChainlinkOracle(ethToUsdOracle).latestRoundData();

        require(ethToUsd > 0, "Chainlink Malfunction");

        if (updateTimeEth < block.timestamp - 1200 seconds) {
            revert("Chainlink Malfunction");
        }
       require(isSequencerActive(), "Sequencer is down");
       require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Stale price");
       require(ethToUsd< _maxPrice, "Upper price bound breached");
       require(ethToUsd> _minPrice, "Lower price bound breached");
```
