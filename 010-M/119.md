# Tokens minted/burned may exceed the max limit if admin decrease the limit.

## Summary
More tokens can still be minted/burned if admin decreases the limit, even if the minted/burned tokens already exceed the new max limit.

## Vulnerability Detail
`_calculateNewCurrentLimit` is used to update the new current minter/burner limit when the admin changes the limits via `setLimits`. The current limit is updated by increasing or decreasing the difference between old limit and new limit. The updating will take effect immediately, even for current `_DURATION`.
```solidity
  function _calculateNewCurrentLimit(
    uint256 _limit,
    uint256 _oldLimit,
    uint256 _currentLimit
  ) internal pure returns (uint256 _newCurrentLimit) {
    uint256 _difference;

    if (_oldLimit > _limit) {
      _difference = _oldLimit - _limit;
@>    _newCurrentLimit = _currentLimit > _difference ? _currentLimit - _difference : 0;
    } else {
      _difference = _limit - _oldLimit;
@>    _newCurrentLimit = _currentLimit + _difference;
    }
  }
```

In the scenario of increasing the limit, the difference between new limit and the old limit is added to `_currentLimit`, as a result, more tokens can be minted/burned than before, and the total number of tokens minted/burned in current `_DURATION` could reach to the **new max limit**. That is to say the new max limit takes effect immediately.

However, in the scenario of decreasing the limit, the reuslt may be unexpected. Let's assume that:
```solidity
oldMaxLimit=200, half `_DURATION` passed, 100 tokens are minted/burned already, currentLimit=0.
```
Admin sets the new max limit to 100, then 50 tokens can still be minted/burned in the next half `_DURATION` according to `_calculateNewCurrentLimit` and `_getCurrentLimit`. However, since 100 tokens (**greater or equal than the new max limit**) have already been minted/burned in current `_DURATION`, no more tokens should be minted/burned in current `_DURATION`.


## Impact
The decreased max limit may not work well, and the bridge may still mint/burn more tokens than the new max limit, even if the number of tokens minted/burned in current `_DURATION` has already exceeded the new limit.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If max limit gets decreased, the calculation of current limit should take into account the minted/burned tokens, and ensure that no more tokens can be minted/burned if it already reaches the new max limit.
