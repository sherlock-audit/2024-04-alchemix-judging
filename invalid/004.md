# The residual amount will continuously accumulate rewards

## Summary

There is a precision loss each time `currentReward` is calculated, leading to a residual amount in the vault. As blocks increase, this residual amount accumulates rewards. If multiple vaults have the same reward, it's possible for one vault to consume rewards intended for others.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `RewardRouter.distributeRewards()` function, the protocol calculates the number of blocks, `blocksSinceLastReward`, elapsed since the last harvest up to the current block. 
```solidity
            uint256 blocksSinceLastReward = block.number - rewards[vault].lastRewardBlock;
```

It then computes the current reward by multiplying the total `rewardAmount` by the proportion of blocks elapsed relative to the rewardTimeframe. 
```solidity
         uint256 maxReward = rewards[vault].rewardAmount - rewards[vault].rewardPaid;
         uint256 currentReward = rewards[vault].rewardAmount * blocksSinceLastReward / rewards[vault].rewardTimeframe;
         uint256 amountToSend = currentReward > maxReward ? maxReward : currentReward;


```

Subsequently, the reward is transferred to the `RewardCollector`, and the `rewards[vault].lastRewardBlock` and `rewards[vault].rewardPaid` quantities are updated. 
```solidity
    TokenUtils.safeTransfer(IRewardCollector(rewards[vault].rewardCollectorAddress).rewardToken(), rewards[vault].rewardCollectorAddress, amountToSend);
            rewards[vault].lastRewardBlock = block.number;
            rewards[vault].rewardPaid += amountToSend;

```

If `rewards[vault].rewardPaid` equals `rewards[vault].rewardAmount`, the protocol sets `rewards[vault].rewardAmount` and `rewards[vault].rewardPaid` to 0.
```solidity
  if (rewards[vault].rewardPaid == rewards[vault].rewardAmount) {
                rewards[vault].rewardAmount = 0;
                rewards[vault].rewardPaid = 0;
            }

```
The issue here is that the calculation of `currentReward` is rounded down, leading to precision loss. This could result in `rewards[vault].rewardPaid` never equaling `rewards[vault].rewardAmount`, preventing the protocol from resetting `rewards[vault]`. Consequently, there will always be residual tokens in this vault, accumulating rewards as blocks increase. If multiple vaults have the same reward, vaults with residual tokens may consume rewards intended for other vaults as blocks increase, causing insufficient rewards to be allocated to the other vaults in the end.


## Impact
The residual tokens will continue to accumulate as blocks increase, consuming rewards intended for other vaults.
