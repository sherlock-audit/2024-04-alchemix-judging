# [H-1] Owner can't recover ERC20 because of misspelling of a check

## Summary [H-1] Owner can't recover ERC20 because of misspelling of a check

## Vulnerability Detail
The `CrossChainCanonicalBase::recoverERC20` function is implemented in the wrong way.
the `!` expression is missing in the second if statement which will lead to a revert even if the bridge token is enabled and eventually, *the owner can't recover ERC20s*

## Impact
The impact is that the owner can't recover ERC20s and will be stuck in the contract. this will happen a lot so The impact and the likelihood are both high

## Code Snippet
[:link:](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-alchemix/blob/main/v2-foundry/src/CrossChainCanonicalBase.sol#L202)(The Reference)
```java
function recoverERC20(address tokenAddress, uint256 tokenAmount) external onlyOwner {
        if (tokenAddress == address(this)) {
            revert IllegalArgument("Illegal token passed");
        }
        // @audit-high this will revert even if the function is called in the right way. impact --> high , likelihood --> high
 @>       if (bridgeTokenEnabled[tokenAddress]) {
            revert IllegalState("Bridge token not enabled");
        }

        TokenUtils.safeTransfer(address(tokenAddress), msg.sender, tokenAmount);
    }

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the `!` expression
```diff
+        if (!bridgeTokenEnabled[tokenAddress]) {
            revert IllegalState("Bridge token not enabled");
        }
```
