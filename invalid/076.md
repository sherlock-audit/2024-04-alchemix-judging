# Bypassing fee payment

## Summary
Bypassing fee payment
## Vulnerability Detail
`bridgeTokensOut -= ((bridgeTokensOut * swapFees[bridgeTokenAddress][1]) / FEE_PRECISION);`
formula will reduct 0 from a `bridgeTokensOut ` in specific cases.

`swapFees[bridgeTokenAddress][1]` is originallly is set to 400
`FEE_PRECISION` is  hardcoded to 10_000

so if a user will call `exchangeCanonicalForOld` function with amount less or equal to 24, user will pay no fees.
`24*400/10_000 == 0`


## Impact
Since contracts will be deployed on L2s with low gas price, user can deploy an attacker contract with build-in loop to call `exchangeCanonicalForOld` function enough times to burn the expected amount and pay 0 in fees.
