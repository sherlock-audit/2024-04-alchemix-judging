# Missing checks for whether Optimism Sequencer is active

## Summary
Missing checks for whether Optimism Sequencer is active
## Vulnerability Detail


the protocol intends to deploy to  Optimism

Chainlink recommends that users using price oracles, check whether the Optimism sequencer is active

If the sequencer goes down, the index oracles may have stale prices, since L2-submitted transactions (i.e. by the aggregating oracles) will not be processed.
## Impact
Stale prices, while fetching the price through `getExpectedExchange` due to sequencer is down the function returns stale price which affects the `minimumAmountOut` in `claimAndDonateRewards`

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use sequencer oracle to determine whether the sequencer is offline or not
