# Absence of rewardPaid Validation in setRewardAmount Function Poses Risk of DoS Attack on distributeRewards in `RewardRouter.sol`

## Summary

In the `RewardRouter.sol` the setRewardAmount function allows the contract owner to set the reward token amount for a specific vault without validating whether the new reward amount exceeds the rewardPaid amount. This oversight may lead to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) in the distributeRewards function, where it will always lead to an overflow not allowing the collector to collect the rewards accumulated in the vault.

## Vulnerability Detail

Follow this scenario

* Bob sets the initial reward to 200 tokens.
* Alice calls to distribute rewards after some blocks, and the amount of rewards paid is 150 tokens.
* Now Bob wants to modify the reward amount to 140 because there is no check in the setRewardAmount function.
```solidity=61
 function sweepTokens(address token, address recipient) external onlyOwner {
        TokenUtils.safeTransfer(token, recipient, TokenUtils.safeBalanceOf(token, address(this)));
    }
    
```
* Any subsequent call to distributeRewards will lead to the transaction reverting due to an underflow, resulting in the collector being unable to collect any reward amounts.
```solidity=41
uint256 maxReward = rewards[vault].rewardAmount - rewards[vault].rewardPaid;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this issue, implement a validation check in the setRewardAmount function to ensure that the new reward amount does not exceed the rewardPaid amount.

```diff=61
+ require(rewardAmount <= rewards[vault].rewardPaid, "New reward amount exceeds rewardPaid");
```
