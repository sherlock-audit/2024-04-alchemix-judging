# Report on Incorrect Reward Calculation in Contract

## Summary
The contract incorrectly calculates the current reward to be distributed using `rewards[vault].rewardAmount` instead of `maxReward`. This leads to an inflated result as it considers both claimed rewards and rewards still available for distribution.

## Vulnerability Detail
 The contract uses the total reward amount (`rewards[vault].rewardAmount`) in the reward calculation instead of the maximum remaining reward (`maxReward = rewards[vault].rewardAmount - rewards[vault].rewardPaid`), leading to inaccurate reward distribution.

## Impact

from the developers's comment  
```solidity
 // Calculates ratio of timeframe to time since last harvest
            // Uses this ratio to determine partial reward amount or extra reward amount
```
 
partial reward amount can be calculated using the ratio of timeframe to time since last harvest.

1. **Inaccurate Reward Distribution**: Using `rewards[vault].rewardAmount` instead of `maxReward` inflates the reward, leading to incorrect distribution.
2. **Economic Impact**: Incorrect reward calculation can affect the economic balance and integrity of the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation


To ensure accurate reward distribution, update the calculation to use `maxReward` instead of `rewards[vault].rewardAmount`. This will provide a more precise calculation based on the actual remaining rewards to be distributed.
