# Corruptible Upgradability Pattern

## Summary
Storage of CrossChainCanonicalAlchemicTokenV2 might be corrupted during an upgrade.

## Vulnerability Detail
[CrossChainCanonicalAlchemicTokenV2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-alchemix/blob/32e4902f77b05ea856cf52617c55c3450507281c/v2-foundry/src/CrossChainCanonicalAlchemicTokenV2.sol#L7-L27) is inherited from `CrossChainCanonicalBase` and `AlchemicTokenV2Base`
And both [AlchemicTokenV2Base](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-alchemix/blob/32e4902f77b05ea856cf52617c55c3450507281c/v2-foundry/src/CrossChainCanonicalBase.sol#L12) and [AlchemicTokenV2Base](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-alchemix/blob/32e4902f77b05ea856cf52617c55c3450507281c/v2-foundry/src/AlchemicTokenV2Base.sol#L22) are upgradable contracts, and both of those two contract uses storage but don't contain any `gap`

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider defining an appropriate storage gap in each upgradeable parent contract at the end of all the storage variable definitions as follows:
```solidity
uint256[50] __gap; // gap to reserve storage in the contract for future variable additions
```
