# claimAndDonateRewards can be frontrun

## Summary

`claimAndDonateRewards` can be frontrun by anyone, passing `minimumAmountOut` as 0 will set the incorrect slippage leading to loss of funds

## Vulnerability Detail
`function claimAndDonateRewards(address token, uint256 minimumAmountOut) external returns (uint256)` can be called by anyone and swaps tokens using Velodrome(DEX on Optimism). The swapped tokens are then sent to `alchemist`. A malicious user could frontrun this transaction and pass`minimumAmountOut` as 0, impacting the expected return from the swap due to slippage.

## Impact
The actual amount received from a swap can be much lower than expected, resulting in financial loss for the `alchemist`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Set a minimum require check for `minimumAmountOut` using a variable. This variable could be controlled by the owner if needed.
