# Forced Donation could cause Issues

## Summary

Summary: The contract forces a donation by sending 1wei of reward tokens to the reward contract. This approach could be exploited to cause DOS or if the donation logic is flawed, potentially leading to loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

Forced Donation with 1wei of Reward Tokens: The contract forces a donation of 1wei of reward tokens to the alchemist depositors. This could be exploited if the alchemist depositors are not properly validated or if the donation logic is flawed.


## Impact

Exploitation of Donation Logic: The forced donation could be used as a form of DOS to flush debtTokens form the contract always
especially when `rewards[vault].rewardAmount == 0`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Validate Alchemist Depositors: Ensure that the alchemist depositors are properly validated before forcing a donation. This could involve checking that the depositor is a legitimate participant in the alchemist protocol.
