# no check for success of swap

## Summary

The claimAndDonateRewards function makes a call to `swapExactTokensForTokens` without verifying the success of the swap operation. This oversight could lead to a situation where the swap fails, but the contract proceeds as if the swap was successful, potentially resulting in the loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

No Check for Success in swapExactTokensForTokens Call: In the claimAndDonateRewards function, the swapExactTokensForTokens function call is made without checking for its success. This could lead to a situation where the swap fails, but the contract proceeds as if the swap was successful, potentially leading to loss of funds.

## Impact

Potential Loss of Funds: If the swapExactTokensForTokens call fails, the contract could lose the reward tokens without any compensation.

## Code Snippet
No Success Check in swapExactTokensForTokens Call:

```solidity
IVelodromeSwapRouter(swapRouter).swapExactTokensForTokens(amountRewardToken, minimumAmountOut, routes, address(this), block.timestamp);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add Success Check for swapExactTokensForTokens Call: Implement a check to ensure that the swapExactTokensForTokens call is successful before proceeding. This could involve checking the return value of the function call or using events to monitor the success of the swap.
