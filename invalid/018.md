# Using `block.timestamp` as the deadline invites MEV

## Summary

The contract uses `block.timestamp` as the deadline for the swap operation in the [claimAndDonateRewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-alchemix/blob/main/v2-foundry/src/utils/collectors/OptimismRewardCollector.sol#L57) function.

Using `block.timestamp` as a deadline means the swap must be executed at any time up to and including the block timestamp at which the transaction is mined. This is inherently risky because it allows miners (or validators, depending on the network) to potentially manipulate the timing of when a transaction is included in a block.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `claimAndDonateRewards` function, `block.timestamp` is used as the deadline for a token swap operation. Since this timestamp corresponds to the time a block is mined, it gives miners the discretion to include the transaction in any block that timestamps up to or even slightly after the block.timestamp when the transaction was sent. If network conditions change or if there is volatility in the market, miners could exploit this to the detriment of the user initiating the swap.

## Impact

Consider a scenario where a large amount of `rewardToken` needs to be swapped for `debtToken` using the VelodromeSwapRouter. If a miner sees that executing this transaction immediately would result in favorable conditions for the user, they could choose to delay this transaction to wait for market conditions where the required `minimumAmountOut` becomes difficult to achieve, thus increasing slippage or even causing the transaction to fail if prices move unfavorably.

## Recommendation

Avoid using `block.timestamp` as a parameter for deadlines directly in smart contract calls that involve financial transactions. Instead, the deadline should be set more conservatively or derived in a way that minimizes the risk of manipulation.
