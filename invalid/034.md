# Initialization of `CrossChainCanonicalBase` and `AlchemicTokenV2Base` can be front run

## Summary
A malicious actor can front run the initialization of the `AlchemicTokenV2Base` and `CrossChainCanonicalBase` giving them full admin rights

## Vulnerability Detail
These contracts can be front-run if the following conditions are met:

1. The contract is deployed but not yet initialized.
2. The transaction calling initialize is visible in the mempool and not yet mined.
3. There are no additional access controls on the initialize function.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-alchemix/blob/main/v2-foundry/src/CrossChainCanonicalAlchemicTokenV2.sol#L12-#L17

## Impact
Malicious users would gain full access control of the contracts

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure that `CrossChainCanonicalAlchemicTokenV2::initialize` is being called in the same transaction the contract is being deployed and/or make the contract `Owanable` and add the `onlyOwner` modifier to the initialization function so only a trusted user can call it.
