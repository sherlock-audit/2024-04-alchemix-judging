# Malicious actors can get admin and sentinel roles in AlchemicTokenV2Base.sol and call all functions intended for those roles

## Summary

Malicious actors can get admin and sentinel roles in `AlchemicTokenV2Base.sol` and call all functions intended for those roles

## Vulnerability Detail

`AlchemicTokenV2Base::__AlchemicTokenV2Base_init()` functions to carry out initial initiation aimed at setting admin and sentinel roles. This function should be called only once and only called upon initiation by [CrossChainCanonicalAlchemicTokenV2.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-alchemix/blob/main/v2-foundry/src/CrossChainCanonicalAlchemicTokenV2.sol#L12-L26). The code for the `AlchemicTokenV2Base::__AlchemicTokenV2Base_init()` function can be seen below :

```solidity
  function __AlchemicTokenV2Base_init() internal {
    _setupRole(ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
    _setupRole(SENTINEL_ROLE, msg.sender);
    _setRoleAdmin(SENTINEL_ROLE, ADMIN_ROLE);
    _setRoleAdmin(ADMIN_ROLE, ADMIN_ROLE);
  }
```

The scenario will go like this :

1. Malicious actor let say Bob, first call [flashloan](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-alchemix/blob/main/v2-foundry/src/AlchemicTokenV2Base.sol#L247-L272) function with his malicious smart contract
2. In the `flashloan` function there is a callback that is made to the receiver and this is of course to the malicious smart contract that Bob has

```solidity
    if (receiver.onFlashLoan(msg.sender, token, amount, fee, data) != CALLBACK_SUCCESS) {
      revert IllegalState();
    }
```

3. By inherited `AlchemicTokenV2Base.sol` as the parent contract and `IERC3156FlashBorrower` as the borrower so that the `flashloan` can be carried out, in Bob's `onFlashloan` function, he performs a reentrancy to call the `__AlchemicTokenV2Base_init()` function.
4. This will work because there is no prevention of re-initiation and there is no modifier in the function to prevent malicious calls that could occur. That way, making the malicious smart contract owned by Bob have an `admin` and `sentinel` role that can call all the functions in `AlchemicTokenV2Base.sol`

## Impact

Malicious actor can became `admin` and `sentinel`, call all functions intended for those roles like `setWhitelist`, sets itself as a whitelist and mints whatever tokens it wants.

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

1. Consider adding a modifier to the contract that allow to call `__AlchemicTokenV2Base_init()`
2. Consider adding a function so that once a contract has been initiated it cannot be initiated again

```solidity
function __AlchemicTokenV2Base_init() internal onlyCrossChainCanonicalAlchemicTokenV2 {
    __ReentrancyGuard_init_unchained();
    _setupRole(ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
    _setupRole(SENTINEL_ROLE, msg.sender);
    _setRoleAdmin(SENTINEL_ROLE, ADMIN_ROLE);
    _setRoleAdmin(ADMIN_ROLE, ADMIN_ROLE);
  }
```
