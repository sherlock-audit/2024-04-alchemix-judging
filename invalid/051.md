# Interaction with Velodrome does not use deadlines for swaps

## Summary
The transaction may remain pending in the mempool for an extended period, and trading activity is highly time-sensitive. Without a deadline check, the trade transaction could be executed long after the user submits it, potentially resulting in the trade being completed at a sub-optimal price, thereby harming the user's position. By passing `block.timestamp` to a pool, the transaction will be deemed valid at the time it is included in a block, as `block.timestamp` will represent the current timestamp.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `OptimismRewardCollector` contract, the `claimAndDonateRewards` function initiates a swap using `swapExactTokensForTokens` and uses `block.timestamp` as the deadline.

## Impact
This could lead to a suboptimal swap, potentially causing the protocol to incur losses up to the specified slippage.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-alchemix/blob/main/v2-foundry/src/utils/collectors/OptimismRewardCollector.sol#L71
```solidity
IVelodromeSwapRouter(swapRouter).swapExactTokensForTokens(amountRewardToken, minimumAmountOut, routes, address(this), block.timestamp); <<< block.timestamp passed as deadline param
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Specify a relevant deadline to prevent the transaction from being delayed and executed at a maximum loss for the protocol.
