# claimAndDonateRewards() can be DOSed, or get alusd/aleth less than expected amounts via swap because of hardcoded routes

## Summary
claimAndDonateRewards() can be DOSed, or get alusd/aleth less than expected amounts via swap because of hardcoded routes

## Vulnerability Detail
In cliamAndDonateRewards function, swap routes are set statically, that is, op->usdc->alusd and op->weth->aleth, and specific factory address.

1. if the factory address is disapproved by velodrome protocol later, swapExactTokensForTokens() will always revert.
`swapExactTokensForTokens() -> getAmountsOut() -> poolFor()`
In poolFor function, there is checking if pool factory is approved or not, like following.
`if (!IFactoryRegistry(factoryRegistry).isPoolFactoryApproved(factory)) revert PoolFactoryDoesNotExist();`

2. at this time that i wrote this report, velodrome recommends op->usdc.e->usdc->alusd to swap op token for alusd, which means that it will make swapper to get maximum output amount. 

## Impact
cliamAndDonateRewards() function will revert or get less than maximum swap output amount which can be expected.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend that protocol needs to have routes setter function.
