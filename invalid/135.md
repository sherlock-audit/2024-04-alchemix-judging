# lack of checks for `minimumAmountOut` causing unexpected returns

## Summary

`minimumAmountOut` value is not checked in the `claimAndDonateRewards` function

## Vulnerability Detail

in the `IRewardCollector`, `claimAndDonateRewards` function there is minimumamountout variable which is the minimum amount user expects after the swap.this check is no where to be found,this can lead to very unexpected returns for the user as the market might fluctuate.

```solidity
 function claimAndDonateRewards(address token, uint256 minimumAmountOut) external returns (uint256 claimed);
```

## Impact

After the swap user might receive very low amount depending on market/external condition
