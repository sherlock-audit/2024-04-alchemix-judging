# The alUSD reward collector should not be reliant on the `ethToUsdOracle`

## Summary

Currently `getExpectedExchange` makes two calls to the Chainlink Oracle: to get the `opToUsd` and `ethToUsd` exchange rates. When the debt token is alETH both of the exchanges will be needed.
But when it is alUSD, only the `opToUsdOracle` is needed, yet calls are made to the `ethToUsdOracle`, making the alUSD reward collector reliant on `ethToUsdOracle`.

## Vulnerability Detail

There are two ways that the results returned from the Chainlink Oracle can make `getExpectedExchange` revert:

1/ if the value returned is 0:
```solidity
require(ethToUsd > 0, "Chainlink Malfunction");
```
2/ if the data returned is stale:
```solidity
if (updateTimeEth < block.timestamp - 1200 seconds) {
      revert("Chainlink Malfunction");
}
```

Therefore, the `ethToUsd` Chainlink Oracle is able to cause the alUSD reward collector to not work properly, even though the `ethToUsd` is completely unnecessary for the alUSD reward collector. If `getExpectedExchange` fails, then `claimAndDonateRewards` will also fail, as the `minimumAmountOut` of `claimAndDonateRewards` is retreived through `getExpectedExchange`, essentially blocking the entire alUSD reward collector.

## Impact

The alUSD reward collector's functionality is completely dependent on the `ethToUsd` Chainlink Oracle, even though it is not using it.

## Recommendation

Move the call to the `ethToUsd` Chainlink Oracle to the following `if` statement:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-alchemix/blob/main/v2-foundry/src/utils/collectors/OptimismRewardCollector.sol#L135-L137

Updated version:
```solidity
 if (debtToken == alUsdOptimism) {
    expectedExchange = totalToSwap * uint(opToUsd) / 1e8;
} else if (debtToken == alEthOptimism) {
      // Ensure that round is complete, otherwise price is stale.
      (
          uint80 roundIDEth,
          int256 ethToUsd,
          ,
          uint256 updateTimeEth,
          uint80 answeredInRoundEth
      ) = IChainlinkOracle(ethToUsdOracle).latestRoundData();
      
      require(
          ethToUsd > 0, 
          "Chainlink Malfunction"
      );

      if( updateTimeEth < block.timestamp - 1200 seconds ) {
          revert("Chainlink Malfunction");
      }
    expectedExchange = totalToSwap * uint(uint(opToUsd)) / uint(ethToUsd);
} else {
    revert IllegalState("Invalid debt token");
}
```
