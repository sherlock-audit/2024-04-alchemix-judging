# The current limit for a paused bridge increases over time

## Summary
The bridge has the following limits: `mintingCurrentLimit, burningCurrentLimit, mintingMaxLimit, and burningMaxLimit`. When the bridge is paused, `mintingCurrentLimit` and `burningCurrentLimit` are restored (increasing towards `maxLimit`).

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's consider the following scenario:
Prerequisite: `mintingMaxLimit` for Bridge A = 1000e18, `mintingCurrentLimit` for Bridge A = 300e18

1) Bridge A is set to pause.
2) 8 hours pass, and Bridge A is unpaused.
3) The `mintingCurrentLimit` will return the next value when minting xalAsset:
```code
calculatedLimit = _limit + (_timePassed * _ratePerSecond)
300e18 + (3600 * 8 * (1000e18 / 86400)) = 633e18
```
After 8 hours have passed, the current minting limit should not change and remain as it was before the pause. (`633e18 > 300e18`)

## Impact
The current minting limit changes over time for a paused bridge in `AlchemicTokenV2Base` smart contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider taking a snapshot of the current minting and burning limits for a paused bridge when the `pauseMinter` function is called.
