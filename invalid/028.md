# Users could avoid paying swap fees when adding a new bridge token

## Summary
In the `CrossChainCanonicalBase` contract, the `addBridgeToken` function is used to add a new bridge token type. However, the `swapFees` information is not added immediately but requires calling the `setSwapFees` function again to include the `swapFees` information. If the owner first calls `addBridgeToken` and `setCeiling`, an exploiter can front-run by calling `exchangeOldForCanonical` or `exchangeCanonicalForOld` functions before calling `setSwapFees`. This allows them to avoid paying the swap fee.

## Vulnerability Detail
Consider the following scenario:

1. The owner calls `addBridgeToken(bridgeTokenAddress)` and `setCeiling(bridgeTokenAddress, 10000000000)`.

2. Before the owner calls `setSwapFees(bridgeTokenAddress, 400, 400)`, an attacker can front-run by calling `exchangeCanonicalForOld(bridgeTokenAddress, 10000000000)` without being charged a fee.

## Impact
Users could avoid paying swap fees when adding a new bridge token.

## Recommendation
It is recommended to add the code for setting `SwapFees` within the `addBridgeToken` function.
