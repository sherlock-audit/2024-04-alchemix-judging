# No storage gaps implemented

## Summary

CrossChainCanonicalBase and AlchemicTokenV2Base are both intended to be upgradeable smart contracts. The issue is that there is no storage gap implemented in both of the contracts. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Storage gaps allow developers to freely add new state variables in the future without compromising the storage compatibility with existing deployments. Furthermore, the absence of this feature raises the possibility of a storage collision occurring in future implementation upgrades.
The same issue has been reported on the Alchemix Code4rena audit and has not been fixed: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-alchemix-findings/issues/44.

## Impact

Storage collisions may occur in future implementation upgrades.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add storage gaps at the end of upgradeable contracts.
