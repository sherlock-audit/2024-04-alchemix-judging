# No check for active L2 Sequencer

## Summary
Chainlink recommends that all Optimistic L2 oracles consult the Sequencer Uptime Feed to ensure that the sequencer is live before trusting the data returned by the oracle. There is no check in the OptimismRewardCollector protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
According to the documentation, only Gelato and Connext are trusted, while the sequencer (external admin) is not trusted by the protocol.
```solidity
Gelato - Gelato is trusted. Gelato can be unresponsive - if gelato is unresponsive, the harvest will fail. This is acceptable as Alchemist admins can manually trigger harvests, and users will still accumulate credit/yield while waiting for a harvest.

Connext - Connext is trusted to operate properly, be responsive, and not steal funds or mint unbacked assets.
```
If the Sequencer goes down, oracle data will not be kept up to date, and thus could become stale. However, users are able to continue to interact with the protocol directly through the L1 optimistic rollup contract. You can review Chainlink docs on [L2 Sequencer Uptime Feeds](https://docs.chain.link/docs/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds/) for more details on this.

As a result, users may be able to use the protocol while oracle feeds are stale. This could cause many problems.

## Impact
If the sequencer goes down, the protocol will use outdated prices.
