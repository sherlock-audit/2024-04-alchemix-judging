# `OptimismRewardCollector` uses one step approval for `rewardToken` .

## Summary
See detail.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens do not allow for approval of positive amount when allowance is positive already (to handle approval race condition, most known example is USDT).

## Impact
approve() will fail to execute on non-standard tokens which require the approval amount to start from zero
