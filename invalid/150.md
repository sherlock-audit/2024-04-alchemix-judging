# Chainlink price is used without checking validity

## Summary

The protocol relies on a Chainlink price oracle to calculate. However, the current implementation lacks checks for the staleness of the price obtained from Chainlink.

## Vulnerability Detail

It is important to provide additional checks that the data is fresh:

> If answeredInRound is less than roundId, the answer is being carried over.
A timestamp with zero value means the round is not complete and should not be used.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-alchemix/blob/main/v2-foundry/src/utils/collectors/OptimismRewardCollector.sol#L91

```sol
        (
            uint80 roundIDEth,
            int256 ethToUsd,
            ,
            uint256 updateTimeEth,
            uint80 answeredInRoundEth
        ) = IChainlinkOracle(ethToUsdOracle).latestRoundData();
        
        require(
            ethToUsd > 0, 
            "Chainlink Malfunction"
        );
```

## Recommendation

Add if answeredInRound is less than roundIdEth check

```sol
        (
            uint80 roundIDEth,
            int256 ethToUsd,
            ,
            uint256 updateTimeEth,
            uint80 answeredInRoundEth
        ) = IChainlinkOracle(ethToUsdOracle).latestRoundData();
        
        require(
            ethToUsd > 0, 
            "Chainlink Malfunction"
        );
       require(
           answeredInRound >= roundIdEth, 
          "Stale price"
       );
```
