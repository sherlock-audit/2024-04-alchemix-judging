# User can bypass fee payment

## Summary
User can bypass fee payment

## Vulnerability Detail
`flashFee` calculates fee shat should be payed, using formula below
```solidity
 function flashFee(address token, uint256 amount) public view override returns (uint256) {
    ...
    return amount * flashMintFee / BPS;
  }
```
Lets focus on `amount * flashMintFee / BPS;` formula
hardcoded values for BPS is 10_000
Lets set flashMintFee  to 0.4%, which is 400.

The issue here is that if the user will call this function and set the `amount` as 24, user will pay 0 in fees

`(24*400/10000) == 0`

SINCE the contract will be deployed on L2s, with very cheap gas price.
A flashloan with such a number less than 24 will be a free flashloan

## Impact
Skipping a fee payment
