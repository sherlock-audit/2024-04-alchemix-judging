# Missing new `slippage` value check while setting

## Summary
Missing new `slippage` value check while setting 
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function setSlippage(uint256 slippage) external onlyOwner {
        slippageBPS = slippage;
    }
```
The upper bound for `slippageBPS ` is `BPS` value, which is 10_000. so `slippageBPS ` should be in 100% cases not more than `BPS` value
## Impact
if `Owner` privatekey will be deprecated, attacker can set a slippage to a value higher than a 10_000, which represents 100% slippage.
To perform a sandwich attack and steal funds

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Set `slippageBPS ` upper bound, for instance on 25% slippage. which is 2_500
```solidity
require(slippage<=2_500, "Too high slippage");
```
implement this code to `setSlippage` function
