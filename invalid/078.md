# safeApprove will revert while a interaction with unique tokens

## Summary
safeApprove will revert while a interaction with unique tokens
## Vulnerability Detail

Since this is a function from a library, we cannot have any predictions, that this function will not be used while interacting with tokens such as USDT

`safeApprove` function make a simple call, and calls a function with `approve.selector`.
In some cases, such as interacting with a USDT, function might be in need to call a "ForceApprove" functionality, as it is done in OZ `safeERC20.sol` contract.


## Impact
Contract that makes an interaction with the token contract, cannot make a separate call to e.g. USDT contract, to set an allowance to 0 before `approve`  to the planned amount.
So the whole protocol might get freezer because of missing "ForceApprove" functionality

## Recommendation
Add Forceapprove functionality as it is done in OZ safeERC20.sol
