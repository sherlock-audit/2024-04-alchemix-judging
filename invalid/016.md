# admins won't be able to change `flashMintFee` to 100%

## Summary
The admins should be able to change `flashMintFee` from `0 - 10000` and the check below is supposed to prevent it from exceeding `10000` i.e 100%.
```solidity
 if (newFee >= BPS) {//@audit-issue what if admin wants to set fee @ 100%
      revert IllegalArgument();
    }
```

But looking closely at the check above, `==` sign is used too. 

## Vulnerability Detail
`BPS` is ==  10_000( same as 10000 i.e 100%)

so if newFee is == `10000` i.e 100%, `AlchemicTokenV2.setFlashFee()` will revert with `IllegalArgument()` error msg.

```solidity
function setFlashFee(uint256 newFee) external onlyAdmin {
    if (newFee >= BPS) {//@audit-issue what if admin wants to set fee @ 100%
      revert IllegalArgument();
    }
    flashMintFee = newFee;
    emit SetFlashMintFee(flashMintFee);
  }
```

This means admins won't be able to set `flashMintFee` to 100% even if they wanted to do. 

I believe this is a bug because admins should be able to change `flashMintFee` from `0 - 10000`, but not above 100%

## Impact
admins won't be able to change `flashMintFee` to 100% even if they wanted.

## Recommendation
change this::
```solidity
-    if (newFee >= BPS) {//@audit-issue admin can't set fee to 100%
      revert IllegalArgument();
    }
```

to this:: 
```solidity
+   if (newFee > BPS) {//@audit-ok admin can set fee to 100% But can't set above 100%, which is how it should be.
      revert IllegalArgument();
    }
```
