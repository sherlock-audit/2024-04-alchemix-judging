# Report on Lack of Token Removal Functionality in CrossChainCanonicalBase.sol Contract

## Summary
The absence of a `removeBridgeToken` function in the contract prevents tokens added via `addBridgeToken` from being removed, even though they can be disabled from swapping.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `addBridgeToken` function allows tokens to be added to `bridgeTokensArray` but lacks a corresponding `removeBridgeToken` function to remove them. This oversight can lead to permanent token inclusion and potential security risks.

## Impact

1. **Permanent Inclusion**: Tokens added mistakenly or maliciously cannot be removed, cluttering the array and causing confusion.
2. **Security Risks**: Inability to remove tokens with vulnerabilities or malicious intent poses security risks.
3. **Economic Impact**: Unsupported or unnecessary tokens might remain swappable, affecting contract stability.
4. **Contract Size and Gas Costs**: Growing contract size from unremovable tokens leads to higher gas costs.
5. **Maintenance Challenges**: Difficulty in managing and updating the contract due to lack of removal capability.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate these risks, it's crucial to implement a `removeBridgeToken` function or a similar mechanism that allows the contract owner to remove tokens from the `bridgeTokensArray` when needed.
