# The reward collector won't operate correctly on both the Arbitrum and Ethereum chains

## Summary
From the README file, we know the following:
1) The reward router/collector is currently intended to be deployed only on `Optimism, Arbitrum, and Ethereum`.
2) Are there any hardcoded values that you intend to change before (some) deployments? - No.

## Vulnerability Detail
Examining the reward collector smart contract (`OptimismRewardCollector`), we see that certain address constants differ between the `Optimism` and `Arbitrum` chains, with identical hardcoded values highlighted in green and different ones in red:
```diff
+    address constant alUsdOptimism = 0xCB8FA9a76b8e203D8C3797bF438d8FB81Ea3326A;
-    address constant alEthOptimism = 0x3E29D3A9316dAB217754d13b28646B76607c5f04;
```

Additionally, Velodrome DEX is deployed only on Optimism and will not operate on Arbitrum and Ethereum chains.
```solidity
IVelodromeSwapRouter(swapRouter).swapExactTokensForTokens(amountRewardToken, minimumAmountOut, routes, address(this), block.timestamp);
```

## Impact
The reward collector won't operate correctly on both the Arbitrum and Ethereum chains

## Recommendation

Make sure that the debt token and other hardcoded values are suitable for each chain, also including the DEXes on each chain.
