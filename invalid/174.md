# The disableInitializer function is not explicitly

## Summary

The contract contains a potential vulnerability in the initialize function, which could allow for re-initialization of the contract's state, leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Detail

The initialize function is marked with the initializer modifier, which is intended to ensure that the function can only be called once. However, there is no explicit check within the function to prevent re-initialization if the contract is upgraded or if the function is called again for any reason. This could lead to the contract's state being reset or overwritten, potentially affecting the contract's functionality and security.

## Impact

If the initialize function is called more than once, it could lead to several issues:

- Loss of State: The contract's state, including important configurations and balances, could be reset or overwritten.
- Security Vulnerabilities: It could introduce security vulnerabilities, such as allowing unauthorized users to reset the contract's state or overwrite important configurations.
- Operational Issues: It could disrupt the contract's operations, leading to loss of trust and potential legal issues.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add the disable_initializer like below

```solidity
function initialize(
    string memory name, 
    string memory symbol, 
    address[] memory _bridgeTokens,
    uint256[] memory _mintCeilings
) external initializer {
    __CrossChainCanonicalBase_init(
      name,
      symbol,
      msg.sender,
      _bridgeTokens,
      _mintCeilings
    );
    __AlchemicTokenV2Base_init();
    __disableInitializer(); // Ensure the initializer can only be called once
}

```
