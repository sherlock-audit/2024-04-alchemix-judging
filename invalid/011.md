# Price can be stale

## Summary

there are not enough checks to ensure that the return price is valid.

## Vulnerability Detail

getExpectedExchange() in OptimismRewardCollector.sol uses latestRoundData to get the latest price. However, there is no check for if the return value is stale data.

## Impact

The staleness of the chainlink return values will lead to wrong calculation
