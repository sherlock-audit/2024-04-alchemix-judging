# Slippage protection doesn't take ETH/alETH and USDC/alUSD conversion rates into calculations

## Summary

Slippage protection calculations do not include some conversion rates, leading to potential high loss of value for the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `OptimismRewardCollector` calculates the expected amount of tokens that a swap will result in.
There are two paths for the swap:
- **Case 1**: OP --> USDC --> alUSD
- **Case 2**: OP --> WETH --> alETH
In both cases, the expected output amount is calculated in `OptimismRewardCollector.getExpectedExchange`.
This expected amount is then used for slippage protection.

However, these calculations make **one important assumption** in both cases:
- USDC/alUSD price rate == 1
- WETH/alETH price rate == 1

At the time of writing this report, 1 alETH can be swapped for 0.9157 WETH on [velodrome.finance](https://velodrome.finance/swap?from=0x3e29d3a9316dab217754d13b28646b76607c5f04&to=0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006).
The price of alETH is valued at ~2,790$ while the WETH price is ~3,044.
This price difference combined with the 5% slippage leads to high loss value for the protocol.

## Impact

The protocol may lose high value during rewards distribution.

## Code Snippet

[`RewardRouter.distributeRewards` calls `OptimismRewardCollector.getExpectedExchange` to get the expected output amount of tokens for a swap at current rates](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-alchemix/blob/main/v2-foundry/src/utils/RewardRouter.sol#L55).

`OptimismRewardCollector.getExpectedExchange` calculates either the [`OP --> USDC` rate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-alchemix/blob/main/v2-foundry/src/utils/collectors/OptimismRewardCollector.sol#L96-L112) or [`OP --> ETH` rate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-alchemix/blob/main/v2-foundry/src/utils/collectors/OptimismRewardCollector.sol#L115-L137).

```solidity
    function getExpectedExchange(address yieldToken) external view returns (uint256) {
        // @POC: ...

        // Ensure that round is complete, otherwise price is stale.
        (
            uint80 roundID,
            int256 opToUsd,
            ,
            uint256 updateTime,
            uint80 answeredInRound
        ) = IChainlinkOracle(opToUsdOracle).latestRoundData();
        
        // @POC: ...

        // Ensure that round is complete, otherwise price is stale.
        (
            uint80 roundIDEth,
            int256 ethToUsd,
            ,
            uint256 updateTimeEth,
            uint80 answeredInRoundEth
        ) = IChainlinkOracle(ethToUsdOracle).latestRoundData();
        
        // @POC: ...

        // Find expected amount out before calling harvest
        if (debtToken == alUsdOptimism) {
            expectedExchange = totalToSwap * uint(opToUsd) / 1e8;
        } else if (debtToken == alEthOptimism) {
            expectedExchange = totalToSwap * uint(uint(opToUsd)) / uint(ethToUsd);
        } else {
            revert IllegalState("Invalid debt token");
        }

        return expectedExchange;
    }
```

As we can see, the `ETH/alETH` and `USD/alUSD` conversion rate are not taken into calculations of the expected output amount.

Finally, [a 5% slippage protection is applied to the calculated output amount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-alchemix/blob/main/v2-foundry/src/utils/RewardRouter.sol#L55C101-L55C203) before being used in the [`OptimismRewardCollector.claimAndDonateRewards` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-alchemix/blob/main/v2-foundry/src/utils/collectors/OptimismRewardCollector.sol#L65-L78). Moreover, the calls to Velodrome Swap Router shows `stable = true` for `WETH/alETH` and `USD/alUSD`, but the rate is not 1.


## Scenario

The following scenario shows the loss of value for the protocol at current exchange rates.

On Discord channel, the sponsor stated:
> So as an example, we have 125k OP to distribute over 6 months.

Price Rates:
- current OP's USD price = $2.20
- current WETH's USD price = $3,044
- current WETH/alETH conversion rate = 3,044 / 2,790 = 1.091

When rewards are distributed, the calculated expected output amount will be:
- expected output = (125,000 * 2.2) / 3,044 = 90.34

The expected amount is 90.34 WETH, but this value is used as the alETH expected amount.
At current rate, the correct output amount is:
- alETH real output amount = 90.34 * 1.091 = 98.56

Moreover, a 5% slippage is applied to the 90.34 value:
- minimum output with slippage = 90.34 * 0.95 = 85.823

Finally, the protocol loss will be `98.56 - 85.823 = 12.737` alETH.
At the current rate, it represents a value of `(12.737 / 1.091) * 3044 =` $35,537.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding the current WETH/alETH and USDC/alUSD price rates into the calculations to limit the loss of value of the protocol.
