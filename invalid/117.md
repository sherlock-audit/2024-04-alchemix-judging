# When debtToken=alUsdOptimism, optimismRewardCollector::getExpectedExchange() can be reverted even though opToUsdOracle works properly.

## Summary
When debtToken=alUsdOptimism, optimisomRewardCollector::getExpectedExchange() can be reverted even though opToUsdOracle works properly.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function getExpectedExchange() is not specified for each case of debt tokens setting.
So if debtToken = alUsdOptimism, it tries to get opToUsd value which is needed, but also tries to get ethToUsd which is not related to the alUsdOptimism.
As a result, It can cause raised possibilities of reverting if ethToUsdOracle not works properly, and if opToUsdOracle works well, getExpectedExchange() should not be reverted regardless of ethToUsdOracle.

## Impact
When debtToken=alUsdOptimism, optimisomRewardCollector::getExpectedExchange() can be reverted even though opToUsdOracle works properly.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The code snippet to get ethToUsd value needs to be placed inside of 'else if (debtToken == alEthOptimism)`
