# `TokenUtils` does not approve 0 first

## Summary
See detail.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens (like USDT) do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value.They must first be approved by zero and then the actual allowance must be approved.

## Impact
safeApprove() will fail to execute on non-standard tokens which require the approval amount to start from zero.
