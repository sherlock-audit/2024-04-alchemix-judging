# An attacker can prevent users from minting and burning any tokens in AlchemicTokenV2Base.sol or making the owner non-stop using setLimits, which is inefficient

## Summary
An attacker can prevent users from minting and burning any tokens in AlchemicTokenV2Base.sol or making the owner non-stop using setLimits, which is inefficient
## Vulnerability Detail
it is basically an old issue from audit: https://code4rena.com/reports/2022-05-alchemix#m-14-a-well-financed-attacker-could-prevent-any-other-users-from-minting-synthetic-tokens

The attacker is going the use the flash loan -> mint -> burn -> repay the flash loan (repeat), because there are no fees
This way he will max out the limit of minting and burning.
## Impact
Users can not use the min or burn function

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

When using the burn function increase the limit of mint and vice versa.

There is a solution in the issue I pasted: 
There should be an additional method that can increment the mint limit. This method can then be called during a burn call in the AlchemistV2 contract.

`function increase(LinearGrowthLimiter storage self, uint256 amount) internal {
  uint256 value = self.get();
  self.lastValue = value + amount > self.maximum ? self.maximum : value + amount;
}
`
