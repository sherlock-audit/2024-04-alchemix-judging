# [M-01] Chainlinkâ€™s latestRoundData might return stale or incorrect results

## Summary

**Chainlink Oracle Data Validation Failures May Lead to Financial Inaccuracies**

## Vulnerability Detail

The smart contract employs Chainlink's `latestRoundData()` function to fetch exchange rates for financial calculations. Critical validations to confirm the completeness and recency of the data are missing. Specifically, the contract omits to check if `answeredInRound` is at least as recent as `roundID`, which is essential to ensure the finality of the data used in calculations.

## Impact

Absence of these checks exposes the contract to risks of using outdated or preliminary data. This could lead to miscalculations in financial operations, potentially affecting transactions involving token swaps, rewards distribution, and other monetary activities tied to the oracle data. The reliability and accuracy of the contract's financial outputs could be significantly compromised, leading to potential losses for users or systemic inaccuracies in the contract's operations.

## Code Snippet

The current implementation snippet involved in fetching and validating data from Chainlink:

```solidity
(
    uint80 roundID, 
    int256 opToUsd,
    ,
    uint256 updateTime,
    uint80 answeredInRound
) = IChainlinkOracle(opToUsdOracle).latestRoundData();

// Existing checks
require(opToUsd > 0, "Chainlink Malfunction");
require(updateTime >= block.timestamp - 1200, "Data is stale");

// Missing crucial check for data finality
// require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "Using incomplete price data");
```

## Tool used
* Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate the risk and improve the integrity of financial computations within the contract, it is advised to:

1. **Implement Finality Check**:
   - Integrate a check to ensure that `answeredInRound` is equal to or greater than `roundID`. This confirms that the data is not only recent but also finalized and accurate for the round in question.
  ```solidity
   require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "Stale or incomplete oracle data");
   ```
