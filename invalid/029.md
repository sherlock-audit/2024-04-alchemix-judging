# Incompatability with fee-on-transfer tokens

## Summary
See detail.

## Vulnerability Detail
 The `RewardRouter` contract do not support fee-on-transfer tokens. If `rewardToken` is a fee-on-transfer token, so in the `distributeRewards` function tokens received by vault `rewardCollectorAddress` could be less than the amount specified in the transfer.

## Impact
The `rewardCollectorAddress` then swaps all the funds into alAssets and donate to the `depositors`.
So the `depositors` could suffer a loss of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider checking the balance of the `rewardCollectorAddress` before and after token transfers and using instead of the amount specified in the contract.
