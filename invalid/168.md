# It is possible to bypass current minting limits set in the AlchemicTokenV2Base contract

## Summary
It is possible to bypass the current minting limits set in the AlchemicTokenV2Base contract. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Here, the mint function in both AlchemicTokenV2Base and CrossChainCanonicalBase is used to mint the CrossChainCanonicalAlchemicTokenV2 tokens. There are minting limits used in the AlchemicTokenV2Base contract. But those same current minting limits are absent in the CrossChainCanonicalBase contract.

So, a user using the `exchangeOldForCanonical` can mint a lot more tokens than current minting limits.

The contest README doesn't specify the details regarding how the contract CrossChainCanonicalBase will be initialised or what functions will be called before initializing the contract to prevent this issue. 

## Impact
More tokens can be minted than intended.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Adjust the `exchangeOldForCanonical` to include the minting limits.
