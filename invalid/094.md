# Lack of Storage Gap in Upgradeable Contract

## Summary
Lack of storage gap in upgradeable contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
When updating upgradeable smart contracts for new features or bug fixes, it's essential to keep the state variables' declaration order unchanged to avoid storage layout issues. 

A practical solution is to include unused state variables or explicitly named storage gaps (like `__gap`) in the base contracts. This foresight allows reserved slots for future use, ensuring that any additions to the contract's state won't disrupt the storage pattern of derived contracts or the compatibility with previously deployed versions.

The problem of "Lack of Storage Gap in Upgradeable Contract" occurs when these storage gaps are not incorporated into the base contract's logic. As a result, if new state variables are added to the base contract, they might overwrite existing variables in the child contracts due to storage slot collisions.

We notice the dependent OpenZeppelin library is version 4.x, for detailed guidelines and best practices, refer to the following OpenZeppelin documentation:
- https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable#storage_gaps
- https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable#storage-gaps

## Impact
Potentially leading to a storage collision.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
For enhanced flexibility in future upgrades of the logic contract, it is prudent to reserve a storage gap of an appropriate size in the base contract. This is achieved by declaring a fixed-size array, typically of `uint256` elements, each occupying a 32-byte slot, in the base contract. Label this array with the identifier `__gap` or any name prefixed with `__gap_` to clearly indicate its purpose as a reserved space.
