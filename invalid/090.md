# Inherited Contracts Not Initialized

## Summary
Inherited contracts not initialized.
## Vulnerability Detail
Contract AlchemicTokenV2Base extends ERC20Upgradeable, AccessControlUpgradeable, ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable, but the extended contract is not initialized by the current contract. Generally, the initializer function of a contract should always call all the initializer functions of the contracts that it extends.
```solidity=22
contract AlchemicTokenV2Base is ERC20Upgradeable, AccessControlUpgradeable, IERC3156FlashLender, ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable {
```
## Impact
Functionality from parent class is not available.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We recommend initializing `ERC20Upgradeable`, `AccessControlUpgradeable`, and `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable`.
