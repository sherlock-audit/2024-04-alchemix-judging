# Malicious user can mint unlimited tokens &  cause DOS to legitimate users


## Summary 

Malicious user can mint n number of tokens by passing a legitimate users bridge address and reach mintCeiling limit as in causing dos too.

## Vulnerability Detail

in the function `exchangeOldForCanonical` which is meant to exchange old tokens for  canonical tokens. Malicious entity can pass in legitimate bridge token address with  an amount which make it reach mintceiling limit for then the user cannot mint any further. Malicious entity can do this by calling mint on legitimate users bridgetoken address.This issue  posses another threat where a malicious enitity can mint n number of tokens everytime using arbitrary legitimate user tokenaddress.

```solidity
        uint256 total = tokenAmount + totalMinted[bridgeTokenAddress];
        if (total > mintCeiling[bridgeTokenAddress]) {
            revert IllegalState();
        }
        totalMinted[bridgeTokenAddress] = total;
```


## Impact
the legitimate user reaches the `mintCeiling` limit without minting anything.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

consider using a modifier or a msg sender check for the function.
