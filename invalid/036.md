# Minting Vulnerability in AlchemicTokenV2Base.sol Contract

## Summary
A paused receiver address should not receive any minted tokens because it is paused but due to sufficient checks it would receive tokens.


## Vulnerability Detail

The contract allows minting into a paused address. While the code restricts minting to whitelisted accounts alone and prevents minting to paused addresses, it fails to check whether the recipient address is paused. This oversight allows whitelisted addresses to mint tokens into paused addresses. The contract only checks if `msg.sender` is paused.
Impact
The example below confirms the absence of a check for the paused status of the recipient address. 
This allows a whitelisted address (User B) to mint tokens into a paused address (User A). 

User A's address has been paused from minting,

 while User B's address is whitelisted and not paused.

 Due to the lack of a check to verify if the recipient of the mint is paused or not, 
User B can easily mint into User A even though User A is paused.


## Impact
Mint function mints to a paused address.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a check to verify whether the recipient address has been paused before allowing minting. Update the minting function with a condition like:
```solidity
if (paused[msg.sender] || paused[recipient]) {
    revert("IllegalState");
}
```
This will prevent minting into paused addresses.
