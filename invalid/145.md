# Reward/Router contract cannot be deployed on Arbitrum

## Summary
Reward/Router contract cannot be deployed on Arbitrum because of hardcoded values

## Vulnerability Detail
In the contest README, the answer to this question is "No":

> Are there any hardcoded values that you intend to change before (some) deployments?
No

But, the hardcoded values for `opToUsdOracle` and `ethToUsdOracle` which are `0x0D276FC14719f9292D5C1eA2198673d1f4269246` and `0x13e3Ee699D1909E989722E753853AE30b17e08c5` respectively, are not the right addresses on Arbitrum. 

Hence, it cannot be deployed on Arbitrum. If it is deployed, then incorrect prices will be used.

## Impact
>On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?
Reward router/collector
The reward router/collector is only currently intended to be deployed on Optimism, Arbitrum, and Ethereum.

The intention is to deploy on Arbitrum and Ethereum as well. But, wrong oracle addresses are being used, which will return incorrect data.

## Recommendation
Use the right addresses before deploying.
