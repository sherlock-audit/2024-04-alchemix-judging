# Funds can be permanently lost

## Summary
Funds can be permanently lost because of no 0 address checks in `RewardRouter.sol::sweepTokens` function.
## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-alchemix/blob/main/v2-foundry/src/utils/RewardRouter.sol#L61-L63
In the `sweepTokens` function there are no zero address checks. Because of this funds can be permanently lost and cannot be recovered. Moreover, it sweeps all of the tokens that the contract contains which is detrimental to the protocol.
## Impact
Complete funds that the contract contains can be lost.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
function sweepTokens(address token, address recipient) external onlyOwner {
        TokenUtils.safeTransfer(token, recipient, TokenUtils.safeBalanceOf(token, address(this)));
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add zero address check in the function
```solidity
function sweepTokens(address token, address recipient) external onlyOwner {
        if(token == address(0)){
             revert IllegalArgument();
         }
        TokenUtils.safeTransfer(token, recipient, TokenUtils.safeBalanceOf(token, address(this)));
    }
```
