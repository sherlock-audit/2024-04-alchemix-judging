# No check for active Optimism and Arbitrum Sequencer for OptimismRewardCollector

## Summary
Chainlink recommends that Optimistic L2 oracles query the Sequencer Uptime Feed to ensure that the sequencer is live before trusting the data returned by the oracle. This check is missed from getExpectedExchange of OptimismRewardCollector, which will be deployed for Optimism and Arbitrum. 

## Vulnerability Detail
If Arbitrum or Optimism sequencer is down, messages cannot be transmitted from L1 to L2, and no L2 transactions are executed. Instead, messages are enqueued in the CanonicalTransactionChain on L1.
During this period, if the price is moving a lot, the new price won't be reported to the chain, the feed on the L2 will return the value it had when it went down.
As a result, returned expected amount may be falsely calculated with outdated prices. 

## Impact
Due to the price not being up to date, falsely calculated exchange amount will be returned.
