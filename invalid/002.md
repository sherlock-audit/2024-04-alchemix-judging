# OptimismRewardCollector Contract Vulnerable to Sandwich Attacks Due to Use of Velodrome Swap Router Without Specific Preventative Measures

### Summary

The OptimismRewardCollector contract is potentially vulnerable to sandwich attacks due to its use of the Velodrome Swap Router to perform token swaps without any specific measures to prevent such attacks.

### Vulnerability Detail

The `claimAndDonateRewards` function in the OptimismRewardCollector contract performs token swaps using the Velodrome Swap Router. However, it does not implement any specific measures to prevent sandwich attacks, where an attacker can front-run or back-run the contract's swap transactions to manipulate token prices and profit from the price slippage.

### Impact

If an attacker successfully performs a sandwich attack on the OptimismRewardCollector contract, they could manipulate the token prices and profit from the price slippage at the expense of the contract's users. This could result in financial losses for the contract and its users.

### Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-alchemix/blob/main/v2-foundry/src/utils/collectors/OptimismRewardCollector.sol#L47-L76

The following code snippet shows the `claimAndDonateRewards` function in the OptimismRewardCollector contract that is potentially vulnerable to sandwich attacks:
```scss
function claimAndDonateRewards(address token, uint256 minimumAmountOut) external returns (uint256) {
    // Amount of reward token claimed plus any sent to this contract from grants.
    uint256 amountRewardToken = IERC20(rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this));

    if (amountRewardToken == 0) return 0;

    if (debtToken == 0xCB8FA9a76b8e203D8C3797bF438d8FB81Ea3326A) {
        // Velodrome Swap Routes: OP -> USDC -> alUSD
        IVelodromeSwapRouter.route[] memory routes = new IVelodromeSwapRouter.route[](2);
        routes[0] = IVelodromeSwapRouter.route(0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000042, 0x7F5c764cBc14f9669B88837ca1490cCa17c31607, false);
        routes[1] = IVelodromeSwapRouter.route(0x7F5c764cBc14f9669B88837ca1490cCa17c31607, 0xCB8FA9a76b8e203D8C3797bF438d8FB81Ea3326A, true);
        TokenUtils.safeApprove(rewardToken, swapRouter, amountRewardToken);
        IVelodromeSwapRouter(swapRouter).swapExactTokensForTokens(amountRewardToken, minimumAmountOut, routes, address(this), block.timestamp);
    } else if (debtToken == 0x3E29D3A9316dAB217754d13b28646B76607c5f04) {
        // Velodrome Swap Routes: OP -> alETH
        IVelodromeSwapRouter.route[] memory routes = new IVelodromeSwapRouter.route[](1);
        routes[0] = IVelodromeSwapRouter.route(0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000042, 0x3E29D3A9316dAB217754d13b28646B76607c5f04, false);
        TokenUtils.safeApprove(rewardToken, swapRouter, amountRewardToken);
        IVelodromeSwapRouter(swapRouter).swapExactTokensForTokens(amountRewardToken, minimumAmountOut, routes, address(this), block.timestamp);
    } else {
        revert IllegalState("Reward collector `debtToken` is not supported");
    }

    // Donate to alchemist depositors
    uint256 debtReturned = IERC20(debtToken).balanceOf(address(this));
    TokenUtils.safeApprove(debtToken, alchemist, debtReturned);
    IAlchemistV2(alchemist).donate(token, debtReturned);

    return amountRewardToken;
}
```
### Tool used

Manual Review

### Recommendation

To mitigate the risk of sandwich attacks, the OptimismRewardCollector contract could consider implementing additional safeguards or using more secure swap mechanisms. Some possible measures to consider include:

* Using a DEX aggregator to split the swap into multiple smaller swaps across different DEXs, which can reduce the price slippage and make it more difficult for attackers to manipulate the token price.
* Implementing advanced swap routing strategies, such as using a dynamic fee model or adjusting the swap route based on the current market conditions.
* Adding a delay between the contract's swap transactions to reduce the likelihood of front-running or back-running attacks.
* Implementing a whitelist or blacklist of addresses that are allowed to interact with the contract, which can help prevent known attackers from executing sandwich attacks.
