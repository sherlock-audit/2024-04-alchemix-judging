# The `AlchemicTokenV2Base.sol` contract is not fully compliant with `xERC20`.

## Summary
See detail.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contracts implements ERC-20 along with mint/burn and some additional rate limit interfaces to be comply with xERC20. However , the ERC-7281(xERC20) specification requires compliant tokens to implement A “Lockbox”: functions or  a simple wrapper contract that consolidates home chain token liquidity and provides a straightforward adoption path for existing ERC20s

The lockbox works as a wrapper of an ERC20. It mints XERC20 tokens at a 1:1 ratio when receiving ERC20 tokens and it unlocks the ERC20 the other way around.

## Impact

Now xERC20 (ERC-7281) tokens are crosschain ERC-20 which can be transferred with slippage across chains without compromising on security if there is absense of lockbox.
Which in not following Connext's xERC20 system - https://docs.connext.network/usecases/xerc20 .

## Recommendation
Consider including `lockbox` in the system.
