# Inaccurate Token Accounting

## Summary

The contract has a flaw in the totalMinted accounting. 

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `exchangeCanonicalForOld` function, tokenAmount is taken out of totalMinted[bridgeTokenAddress] without taking into consideration possible service fees. The `tokenAmount` is then burnt and a potentially smaller amount is sent to the end user, as per the fee guidelines. In this case, the totalMinted variable would be greater than the actual supply, resulting in an incorrect minted total calculation. 

## Impact

This could lead to potential complications and incorrect metrics.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-alchemix/blob/main/v2-foundry/src/CrossChainCanonicalBase.sol#L131-L144

```solidity
...
// Burn the canonical tokens
super._burn(msg.sender, tokenAmount);

// Handle the fee, if applicable
bridgeTokensOut = tokenAmount;
if (!_isFeeExempt(msg.sender)) {
    bridgeTokensOut -= ((bridgeTokensOut * swapFees[bridgeTokenAddress][1]) / FEE_PRECISION);
}

// Update mint count
totalMinted[bridgeTokenAddress] -= tokenAmount;

// Give old tokens to the sender
TokenUtils.safeTransfer(bridgeTokenAddress, msg.sender, bridgeTokensOut);
...
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A correct accounting of the amount burnt (which might include service fees) needs to be tracked. To avoid an inaccurate count, the totalMinted should be deducted by the actual amount of tokens sent to the user (i.e., bridgeTokensOut). This adjustment will ensure the mechanism maintains an accurate total of minted tokens.
