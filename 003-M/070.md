# Usage of `block.number` will issue different rewards based on the chain

## Summary

Depending on the chain at which `RewardRouter` is deployed grant rewards will be distributed at different rates, due to the non-consistent block mining in the desired chains.

## Vulnerability Detail

The Alchemix team has [stated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-alchemix?tab=readme-ov-file#q-on-what-chains-are-the-smart-contracts-going-to-be-deployed) that they want to deploy the `RewardRouter` at the following chains (with block times): 

- Optimism ~ 2s
- Arbitrum ~ 2.2s
- Ethereum ~ 12s

It can be clearly seen that rewards in mainnet will be distributed 6 times slower.

## Impact

Slower reward distribution, due to non-consistent block mining

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider using `block.timestamp` instead of `block.number`, it has no differences across chains.
