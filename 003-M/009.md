# `block.number` is unreliable source of time on Arbitrum

## Summary
`block.number` is used in RewardRouter.sol to distribute OP tokens continuously over defined amount of time. RewardRouter is supposed to be deployed on Arbitrum, Optimism, Mainnet according to contest's README.

Problem is that Arbitrum's `block.number` doesn't increase continuosly unlike Mainnet and Optimism.

## Vulnerability Detail
According to [Arbitrum documentation](https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/arbitrum-vs-ethereum/block-numbers-and-time#arbitrum-block-numbers):
>ArbOS and the sequencer are responsible for delineating when one Arbitrum block ends and the next one begins. However, block creation depends entirely on chain usage, meaning that blocks are only produced when there are transactions to sequence. In active chains, one can expect to see Arbitrum blocks produced at a relatively steady rate. In more quiet chains, block production might be sporadic depending on the rate at which transactions are received.

RewardRouter uses `block.number` to estimate past period of time: `rewardTimeframe` is meant to be the period in which amount `rewardAmount` must be distributed:
```solidity
    function distributeRewards(address vault) external returns (uint256) {
        // If vault is set to receive rewards from grants, send amount to reward collector to donate
        if (rewards[vault].rewardAmount > 0) {
            // Calculates ratio of timeframe to time since last harvest
            // Uses this ratio to determine partial reward amount or extra reward amount
@>          uint256 blocksSinceLastReward = block.number - rewards[vault].lastRewardBlock;
            uint256 maxReward = rewards[vault].rewardAmount - rewards[vault].rewardPaid;
            uint256 currentReward = rewards[vault].rewardAmount * blocksSinceLastReward / rewards[vault].rewardTimeframe;
            uint256 amountToSend = currentReward > maxReward ? maxReward : currentReward;

            TokenUtils.safeTransfer(IRewardCollector(rewards[vault].rewardCollectorAddress).rewardToken(), rewards[vault].rewardCollectorAddress, amountToSend);
            rewards[vault].lastRewardBlock = block.number;
            ...
        }

        return IRewardCollector(rewards[vault].rewardCollectorAddress).claimAndDonateRewards(vault, IRewardCollector(rewards[vault].rewardCollectorAddress).getExpectedExchange(vault) * slippageBPS / BPS);
    }
```

It works well because in Mainnet block time is 12 sec, on Optimism it's 2 sec. But in Arbitrum can't be calculated in advance to [define 6 months period as defined here](https://discord.com/channels/812037309376495636/1229446161342009529/1229820891022758029)

## Impact
Tokens are meant to be distributed continuously over defined period of time. However actual speed of distribution depends on network congestion of Arbitrum: sporadic when there is low usage.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Refactor to use `block.timestamp` instead.
