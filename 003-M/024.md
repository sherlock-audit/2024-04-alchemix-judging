# Inaccurate Timing and Reward Distribution on L2 Networks Using `block.number`

## Summary

The use of `block.number` in the [distributeRewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-alchemix/blob/main/v2-foundry/src/utils/RewardRouter.sol#L35) function for timing or calculating intervals between reward distributions is problematic on Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism. This is due to how `block.number` behaves differently on these platforms compared to Ethereum Mainnet.

## Vulnerability Detail

The distributeRewards function uses `block.number` to calculate the number of blocks since the last reward was paid (blocksSinceLastReward) and to determine the amount of the current reward to distribute. This approach assumes a consistent progression of blocks as a proxy for time, which holds true on Ethereum Mainnet but not on L2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism.

[Arbitrum](https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/arbitrum-vs-ethereum/block-numbers-and-time): The block.number corresponds to the latest Ethereum Layer 1 block number known to the Arbitrum sequencer, which updates approximately once per minute. This means that block.number does not increment in real-time with each Arbitrum block, making it unreliable for measuring time intervals or elapsed blocks in a Layer 2 context.

[Optimism](https://docs.optimism.io/chain/differences#block-numbers-and-timestamps): Every transaction on Optimism is treated as a block, so the block.number increments with every transaction, providing no consistent measure of time.

## Impact

The reliance on block.number for timing calculations can have several adverse effects:
1. Since `block.number` does not reflect real-time block progression on L2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism, reward calculations based on this metric can lead to inaccurate and inconsistent reward distributions. Rewards might be calculated based on incorrect intervals, leading to either overpayment or underpayment.

2. On Optimism, where each transaction is a block, users could manipulate the timing of rewards by clustering transactions to artificially advance the block.number, allowing them to claim rewards prematurely.

3. On Arbitrum, the slower update of block.number could delay reward distributions, affecting user experience and potentially the financial performance of the protocol.

/// @dev Distributes grant rewards and triggers reward collector to claim and donate
    function distributeRewards(address vault) external returns (uint256) {
        // If vault is set to receive rewards from grants, send amount to reward collector to donate
        if (rewards[vault].rewardAmount > 0) {
            // Calculates ratio of timeframe to time since last harvest
            // Uses this ratio to determine partial reward amount or extra reward amount
            uint256 blocksSinceLastReward = block.number - rewards[vault].lastRewardBlock;
            uint256 maxReward = rewards[vault].rewardAmount - rewards[vault].rewardPaid;
            uint256 currentReward = rewards[vault].rewardAmount * blocksSinceLastReward / rewards[vault].rewardTimeframe;
            uint256 amountToSend = currentReward > maxReward ? maxReward : currentReward;

            TokenUtils.safeTransfer(IRewardCollector(rewards[vault].rewardCollectorAddress).rewardToken(), rewards[vault].rewardCollectorAddress, amountToSend);
            rewards[vault].lastRewardBlock = block.number;
            rewards[vault].rewardPaid += amountToSend;

            if (rewards[vault].rewardPaid == rewards[vault].rewardAmount) {
                rewards[vault].rewardAmount = 0;
                rewards[vault].rewardPaid = 0;
            }
        }

        return IRewardCollector(rewards[vault].rewardCollectorAddress).claimAndDonateRewards(vault, IRewardCollector(rewards[vault].rewardCollectorAddress).getExpectedExchange(vault) * slippageBPS / BPS);
    }

## Recommendation

Instead of relying solely on `block.number`, incorporate block timestamps (block.timestamp) or external timestamp sources to calculate time intervals accurately.
