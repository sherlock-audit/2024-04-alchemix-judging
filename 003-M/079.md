# Issues with distribution of rewards due to block.number usage

## Summary
`RewardRouter::distributeRewards` is used for reward distribution and proceeds to trigger the reward collector. `block.number` is used for the `blocksSinceLastReward` calculation, which is used for the `currentReward` calculation. `block.number` is known to have different effects on Arbitrum and Optimism compared to Ethereum, which will cause issues with the reward calculation. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol mentions that "The reward router/collector is only currently intended to be deployed on Optimism, Arbitrum, and Ethereum.".

`RewardRouter::distributeRewards` [#L35-56](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-alchemix/blob/main/v2-foundry/src/utils/RewardRouter.sol#L35-L56)
```javascript
    /// @dev Distributes grant rewards and triggers reward collector to claim and donate
    function distributeRewards(address vault) external returns (uint256) {
        // If vault is set to receive rewards from grants, send amount to reward collector to donate
        if (rewards[vault].rewardAmount > 0) {
            // Calculates ratio of timeframe to time since last harvest
            // Uses this ratio to determine partial reward amount or extra reward amount
@>          uint256 blocksSinceLastReward = block.number - rewards[vault].lastRewardBlock;
            uint256 maxReward = rewards[vault].rewardAmount - rewards[vault].rewardPaid;
@>          uint256 currentReward = rewards[vault].rewardAmount * blocksSinceLastReward / rewards[vault].rewardTimeframe;
            uint256 amountToSend = currentReward > maxReward ? maxReward : currentReward;

            TokenUtils.safeTransfer(IRewardCollector(rewards[vault].rewardCollectorAddress).rewardToken(), rewards[vault].rewardCollectorAddress, amountToSend);
@>          rewards[vault].lastRewardBlock = block.number;
            rewards[vault].rewardPaid += amountToSend;

            if (rewards[vault].rewardPaid == rewards[vault].rewardAmount) {
                rewards[vault].rewardAmount = 0;
                rewards[vault].rewardPaid = 0;
            }
        }

        return IRewardCollector(rewards[vault].rewardCollectorAddress).claimAndDonateRewards(vault, IRewardCollector(rewards[vault].rewardCollectorAddress).getExpectedExchange(vault) * slippageBPS / BPS);
    }
```

Anyone can call this function, while the reward parameters are set by the owner.

[Arbitrum Docs](https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/arbitrum-vs-ethereum/block-numbers-and-time) explain how `block.number` corresponds roughly to the Ethereum mainnet's block number at the time the transaction is processed by the sequencer, not when it is finalized on the L2. Although this number syncs approximately every minute, some issues that could arise are scenarios where out of sync `block.number` may be used causing less reward distributed than it should, and since the `rewards[vault].lastRewardBlock` is updated at that point, a much longer time will be needed to claim the rest of the rewards.

[Optimism Docs](https://docs.optimism.io/chain/differences) explain how each transaction is it's own block, therefore `block.number` may easily exceed the intended `rewardTimeframe` set by the owner, allowing rewards to be distributed much sooner than intended.


## Impact
Issues with reward distribution on Arbitrum and Optimism as explained above.
