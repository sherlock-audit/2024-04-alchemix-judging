# Loss of accuracy in reward distribution using block.number

## Summary
When deploying to Optimism, 'blocksSinceLastReward' will not be accurate due to the use of block.number. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The inaccuracy of block.number will affect the computation of the 'currentReward'. That will affect 'amountToSend'. Which will affect the accuracy of the reward distribute

## Impact
On Optimism, the block.number is not a reliable source of timing information. 
What in 'distributeRewards() ' will affect the accuracy of the sum calculation

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using block.timestamp instead of block.number for more accurate measurement of time.
