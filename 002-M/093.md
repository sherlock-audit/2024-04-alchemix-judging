# `distributeRewards` may be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

## Summary
`distributeRewards` may be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `RewardRouter.distributeRewards`, rewards are calculated and sent to the reward collector. However, the rewards storage is updated after the tokens are transferred, making it vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. If the reward token contract calls the recipient when `transfer`ring tokens, for example to notify the recipient of the token update, the recipient can repeatedly call the `distributeRewards` to deplete the reward tokens held by the `RewardRouter` contract.
```solidity
    function distributeRewards(address vault) external returns (uint256) {
        // If vault is set to receive rewards from grants, send amount to reward collector to donate
        if (rewards[vault].rewardAmount > 0) {
            // Calculates ratio of timeframe to time since last harvest
            // Uses this ratio to determine partial reward amount or extra reward amount
            uint256 blocksSinceLastReward = block.number - rewards[vault].lastRewardBlock;
            uint256 maxReward = rewards[vault].rewardAmount - rewards[vault].rewardPaid;
            uint256 currentReward = rewards[vault].rewardAmount * blocksSinceLastReward / rewards[vault].rewardTimeframe;
            uint256 amountToSend = currentReward > maxReward ? maxReward : currentReward;

@>          TokenUtils.safeTransfer(IRewardCollector(rewards[vault].rewardCollectorAddress).rewardToken(), rewards[vault].rewardCollectorAddress, amountToSend);
@>          rewards[vault].lastRewardBlock = block.number;
@>          rewards[vault].rewardPaid += amountToSend;

            if (rewards[vault].rewardPaid == rewards[vault].rewardAmount) {
                rewards[vault].rewardAmount = 0;
                rewards[vault].rewardPaid = 0;
            }
        }
...
    }

## Impact
`distributeRewards` may be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks, and the reward tokens held by the `RewardRouter` contract may be depleted.
