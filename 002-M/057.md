# `RewardRouter::distributeRewards()` can be blocked from distribute rewards

## Summary
`RewardRouter::distributeRewards()` function can be prevented from distributing rewards to the `rewardCollector`

## Vulnerability Detail
`RewardRouter.distributeRewards()` are external without any access modifiers and can be called by anyone.
```solidity
    function distributeRewards(address vault) external returns (uint256) {
```
Logic of this function gives the ability malicious user to effectively lock reward
```solidity
            uint256 blocksSinceLastReward = block.number - rewards[vault].lastRewardBlock;
            uint256 maxReward = rewards[vault].rewardAmount - rewards[vault].rewardPaid;
            uint256 currentReward = rewards[vault].rewardAmount * blocksSinceLastReward / rewards[vault].rewardTimeframe;
            uint256 amountToSend = currentReward > maxReward ? maxReward : currentReward;

            TokenUtils.safeTransfer(IRewardCollector(rewards[vault].rewardCollectorAddress).rewardToken(), rewards[vault].rewardCollectorAddress, amountToSend);
            rewards[vault].lastRewardBlock = block.number;
            rewards[vault].rewardPaid += amountToSend;
```

If `rewards[vault].rewardAmount > 0` but `rewards[vault].rewardAmount < rewards[vault].rewardTimeframe`

- Bob call `distributeRewards()` each block.
- `currentReward = rewards[vault].rewardAmount * 1 / rewards[vault].rewardTimeframe` because rounding `currentReward` will be `0`
- `0` be assigned to `amountToSend` and `0` tokens will be sent to `rewards[vault].rewardCollectorAddress`
- update `lastRewardBlock` to current block: `rewards[vault].lastRewardBlock = block.number`
- in the next block, Bob calls this function again.
- gelato called `AlchemixHarvester::harvest()` but `rewardRouter` won't send any reward.

## Impact
`AlchemixHarvester::harvest()` can be called only by gelato:
```solidity
    if (msg.sender != gelatoPoker) {
      revert Unauthorized();
    }
```
at the end of function logic `harvest()` calls:
```solidity
    if (rewardCollector != address(0)) {
      IRewardRouter(rewardRouter).distributeRewards(yieldToken);
    }
```
`rewardRouter` won't distribute any reward.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Restrict access to `RewardRouter.distributeRewards()` since it calls only `AlchemixHarvester::harvest()` or don't update state if `currentReward` == 0
