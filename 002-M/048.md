# The lack of initialization of the `lastRewardBlock` causes `distributeRewards` to not work properly when setting the reward amount, resulting in a shorter reward distribution time.

## Summary
`setRewardAmount` function in `RewardRouter` contract only sets `rewardAmount` but not `lastRewardBlock` to current block.
Since `lastRewardBlock` is not updated, distribution rewards will be increased higher than expected right after calling `setRewardAmount`.  

## Vulnerability Detail
setRewardAmount function doesn't initialize `lastRewardBlock`, so this value is zero in the first distribution.
And it doesn't check if `rewardAmount` is set already.
```solidity
function setRewardAmount(address vault, uint256 rewardAmount) external onlyOwner {
        rewards[vault].rewardAmount = rewardAmount;
}
```

The `distributeRewards` function is intended to distribute rewards during the `rewardTimeframe`.
```solidity
function distributeRewards(address vault) external returns (uint256) {
        // If vault is set to receive rewards from grants, send amount to reward collector to donate
        if (rewards[vault].rewardAmount > 0) {
            // Calculates ratio of timeframe to time since last harvest
            // Uses this ratio to determine partial reward amount or extra reward amount
40:         uint256 blocksSinceLastReward = block.number - rewards[vault].lastRewardBlock;
41:         uint256 maxReward = rewards[vault].rewardAmount - rewards[vault].rewardPaid;
42:         uint256 currentReward = rewards[vault].rewardAmount * blocksSinceLastReward / rewards[vault].rewardTimeframe;
43:         uint256 amountToSend = currentReward > maxReward ? maxReward : currentReward;

            TokenUtils.safeTransfer(IRewardCollector(rewards[vault].rewardCollectorAddress).rewardToken(), rewards[vault].rewardCollectorAddress, amountToSend);
            rewards[vault].lastRewardBlock = block.number;
            rewards[vault].rewardPaid += amountToSend;

            if (rewards[vault].rewardPaid == rewards[vault].rewardAmount) {
                rewards[vault].rewardAmount = 0;
                rewards[vault].rewardPaid = 0;
            }
        }

        return IRewardCollector(rewards[vault].rewardCollectorAddress).claimAndDonateRewards(vault, IRewardCollector(rewards[vault].rewardCollectorAddress).getExpectedExchange(vault) * slippageBPS / BPS);
}
```
Therefore, `blocksSinceLastReward`  would be much greater than `rewardTimeframe` if lastRewardBlock is not set and distribution will be done immediately(for unadded vault). 

## Impact
Reward distribution is not working properly.
1. if owner calls the `setRewardAmount` function directly without calling `addVault` function, the reward is distributed immediately because `lastRewardBlock` is zero. 
2. For an already added vault, calling `setRewardAmount` function will remove the remaining reward amount and reset rewards if all `rewardAmount` has not been paid out.
3. Even if all the `rewardAmount` has been paid out, new initial reward rate will be increased because `lastRewardBlock` has not been updated to current block.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In the reward distribution, revert if `rewardAmount` is not zero, and initialize `lastRewardBlock` to current block number.   
```solidity
++    error AllRewardNotDistributed(); 

function setRewardAmount(address vault, uint256 rewardAmount) external onlyOwner {
++      if (rewardAmount != 0)
                revert AllRewardNotDistributed();  
        rewards[vault].rewardAmount = rewardAmount;
++      if (rewards[vault].lastRewardBlock < block.number) {
++          rewards[vault].lastRewardBlock = block.number;
++      }
}
```
