# [H-01] Potential Reentrancy Vulnerability in `distributeRewards()` Function of RewardRouter Contract

## Summary

The `distributeRewards()` function in the RewardRouter contract has a potential reentrancy vulnerability due to an external call made before the state of the contract is fully settled.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `distributeRewards()` makes an external call to `IRewardCollector(rewards[vault].rewardCollectorAddress).claimAndDonateRewards(...)`. This external call is made before the state of `rewards[vault]` is fully settled. Specifically, `rewards[vault].lastRewardBlock` and `rewards[vault].rewardPaid` are updated after the external call. If the `IRewardCollector` contract is malicious and implements a fallback function that calls back into `distributeRewards()`, it could potentially manipulate the state of `rewards[vault]`.

## Impact

If exploited, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to manipulate the state of the contract, potentially leading to loss of funds or other unexpected behavior.

## Tool used
* Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this, consider following the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which suggests performing any external calls last, after all internal work (including state changes) is done. Also, consider using reentrancy guards to prevent recursive calls. See the example fix below that follows the CEI pattern:

```solidity
function distributeRewards(address vault) external returns (uint256) {
    // Check if the vault is set to receive rewards from grants
    if (rewards[vault].rewardAmount > 0) {
        // Calculate the blocks since the last reward
        uint256 blocksSinceLastReward = block.number - rewards[vault].lastRewardBlock;
        // Calculate the maximum reward
        uint256 maxReward = rewards[vault].rewardAmount - rewards[vault].rewardPaid;
        // Calculate the current reward
        uint256 currentReward = rewards[vault].rewardAmount * blocksSinceLastReward / rewards[vault].rewardTimeframe;
        // Determine the amount to send
        uint256 amountToSend = currentReward > maxReward ? maxReward : currentReward;

        // Update the last reward block and the reward paid
        rewards[vault].lastRewardBlock = block.number;
        rewards[vault].rewardPaid += amountToSend;

        // If all rewards have been paid, reset the reward amount and reward paid
        if (rewards[vault].rewardPaid == rewards[vault].rewardAmount) {
            rewards[vault].rewardAmount = 0;
            rewards[vault].rewardPaid = 0;
        }

        // Transfer the reward to the reward collector
        TokenUtils.safeTransfer(IRewardCollector(rewards[vault].rewardCollectorAddress).rewardToken(), rewards[vault].rewardCollectorAddress, amountToSend);
    }

    // Call the reward collector to claim and donate rewards
    return IRewardCollector(rewards[vault].rewardCollectorAddress).claimAndDonateRewards(vault, IRewardCollector(rewards[vault].rewardCollectorAddress).getExpectedExchange(vault) * slippageBPS / BPS);
}
