# `RewardRouter:distributeReward` is exposed to reentrancy attacks

## Summary:
`distributeRewards` is lacking reentrancy modifier guard. In the function, internal mapping takes after calling the `TokenUtils.safeTransfer()`. Attacker can create an attacker contract and use it as `_reciever` and drain tokens from the fund.

## Vulnerability Detail: 
Malicious contract can recall this function from it's `recieve()` after recieving token, this will call the `distributeRewards()` again without completing the previous call. This way internal accounting won't take place and the attacker contract can drain all funds.


## Impact:
Token can be drained from the protocol.

## Code Snippet:
```javascript
function distributeRewards(address vault) external returns (uint256) {
        
        if (rewards[vault].rewardAmount > 0) {
            ...
            TokenUtils.safeTransfer(IRewardCollector(rewards[vault].rewardCollectorAddress).rewardToken(), rewards[vault].rewardCollectorAddress, amountToSend);
            rewards[vault].lastRewardBlock = block.number;
            rewards[vault].rewardPaid += amountToSend;
            if (rewards[vault].rewardPaid == rewards[vault].rewardAmount) {
                rewards[vault].rewardAmount = 0;
                rewards[vault].rewardPaid = 0;
            }
        }


    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation:
Use non-reentrant modifier from openzeppelin-library.
