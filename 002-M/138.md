# `setRewardAmount` should reset a vault's `lastRewardBlock`

## Summary

In order to set or increase a vault's reward `setRewardAmount` must be called, which sets the value of `rewards[vault].rewardAmount`. The issue is that `setRewardAmount` does not reset the vault's `lastRewardBlock`, allowing the vault to claim their reward much quicker than intended.

## Vulnerability Detail

The amount of reward that a vault can claim at a certain point in time is calculated the following way:

```solidity
uint256 blocksSinceLastReward = block.number - rewards[vault].lastRewardBlock;
uint256 maxReward = rewards[vault].rewardAmount - rewards[vault].rewardPaid;
uint256 currentReward = rewards[vault].rewardAmount * blocksSinceLastReward / rewards[vault].rewardTimeframe;
uint256 amountToSend = currentReward > maxReward ? maxReward : currentReward;
```

The value of `rewards[vault].lastRewardBlock` plays an immense role in this calculation. The lower it is, the more rewards the vault is going to be able to claim. Therefore, it is essential that when a vault's reward amount is set, the `lastRewardBlock` is reset to the current `block.number`. Here is an example to showcase how this can be an issue:

1/ A vault is added to the `rewards` array, with a `lastRewardBlock` equal to `block.number` and a `rewardTimeframe` equal to 6 months.
2/ The 6 months pass and the vault claims all of the rewards. This sets the vault's `lastRewardBlock` to 6 months(in blocks) after the time of step 1/.
3/ 3 months later, more rewards are assigned to the vault. Therefore, `setRewardAmount` is called but the vault's `lastRewardBlock` is still equal to the time from step 2/.
4/ The vault disrtibutes rewards and claims the rewards for 3 months, even though no time has passed since step 3/.


## Impact

Vaults can claim rewards quicker than expected.
