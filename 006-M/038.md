# Report on Non-Compliance with ERC-3156 Standards in AlchemicTokenV2Base Contract

## Summary
The AlchemicTokenV2Base contract does not fully comply with ERC-3156 standards for flash loans. The current implementation of the flash loan function in the contract does not align with the standard's requirements.
## Vulnerability Detail
None conformance to standard. _spendAllowance(address(receiver), address(this), amount + fee); is required before the burning action.

## Impact

ERC-3156 Standard: [EIP-3156 Flash Borrower Reference Implementation](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3156#flash-borrower-reference-implementation)

 Existing Code:
```solidity
_burn(address(receiver), amount + fee); // Will throw error if not enough to burn
return true;
```

 Recommended Code Update:
```solidity
address flashFeeReceiver = _flashFeeReceiver();
_spendAllowance(address(receiver), address(this), amount + fee);
if (fee == 0 || flashFeeReceiver == address(0)) {
    _burn(address(receiver), amount + fee);
} else {
    _burn(address(receiver), amount);
    _transfer(address(receiver), flashFeeReceiver, fee);
}
return true;
```

Update the flash loan function in the AlchemicTokenV2Base contract to align with ERC-3156 standards. Replace the existing code with the recommended code update to ensure compliance with the standard.
