# flashLoan does not check or spend allowance before burning tokens, potentially allowing attackers to burn tokens from ERC3156 compliant receivers

## Summary
`AlchemicTokenV2Base` attempts to implement ERC3156 compliant flash loan functionality, but it does not check or spend allowance before burning tokens when repaying the flash loan. This can allow a flash loan receiver with an ERC3156 compliant implementation to be drained of their funds by an attacker using `flashLoan`.

## Vulnerability Detail
TheÂ [EIP-3156](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3156) specification states:

"For the transaction to not revert, `receiver` MUST approve `amount + fee` of `token` to be taken by `msg.sender` before the end of `onFlashLoan`."

As stated in the specification, and shown in the reference implementation, the receiver must approve the tokens and fee which are taken from it during the flash loan process. However, the implementation of `flashLoan` calls `_burn` directly and does not check or spend allowance during the flash loan process. According to the ERC3156 specification, tokens must be approved for the transaction to not revert.

## Impact
This missing check could cause a receiver contract which is compliant with ERC3156 to have their funds drained by an attacker calling `flashLoan` to their contract. This will spend some of their tokens on the fee which have not been previously approved, if this is done with enough tokens or with multiple calls it could drain their entire balance.

```solidity
  function flashLoan(
    IERC3156FlashBorrower receiver,
    address token,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes calldata data
  ) external override nonReentrant returns (bool) {
    if (token != address(this)) {
      revert IllegalArgument();
    }

    if (amount > maxFlashLoan(token)) {
      revert IllegalArgument();
    }

    uint256 fee = flashFee(token, amount);

    _mint(address(receiver), amount);

    if (receiver.onFlashLoan(msg.sender, token, amount, fee, data) != CALLBACK_SUCCESS) {
      revert IllegalState();
    }

    _burn(address(receiver), amount + fee); // Will throw error if not enough to burn

    return true;
  }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Require the receiver to approve `amount + fee` to the lender and spend the allowance before burning tokens.
