# User are able to take `flashLoan`  without paying the `flashFee`.

## Summary
When user takes a flashloan, the tokens are minted to reciever and reciever have to repay these minted token with some additional fee called `flashFee` within the same transaction. However , here user can avoid `flashFee` and take `flashLoan`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `flashFee` calculated for reciever like this

```javascript
 function flashFee(address token, uint256 amount) public view override returns (uint256) {
    if (token != address(this)) {
      revert IllegalArgument();
    }
    return amount * flashMintFee / BPS;
 }
```
And we can see that `flashMintFee` will always be less then `BPS`.

```javascript
function setFlashFee(uint256 newFee) external onlyAdmin {
    if (newFee >= BPS) {
      revert IllegalArgument();
    }
    flashMintFee = newFee;
    emit SetFlashMintFee(flashMintFee);
  }
```

So now lets consider a scenario for user taking `flashLoan` where 

1) amount = 10 .
2) flashMintFee = 100 .
3) BPS = 10000 .

Using above `flashFee` formula 

`flashFee` = 10 * 100 / 10000 = 0 , due to rounding down .

## Impact
User could take `flashLoan` in chunks without paying `flashFee`.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider include a check while burning the tokens from reciever.

```javascript
if (fee != 0){
    _burn(address(receiver), amount + fee);
}
```
