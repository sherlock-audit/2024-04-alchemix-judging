# Potential DOS in OptimismRewardCollector::getExpectedExchange

## Summary
Calls to Oracles have the potential to revert, potentially leading to a total Denial-of-Service for smart contracts reliant on them. Chainlink multisigs hold the power to instantly restrict access to price feeds as desired, meaning the functionality of a price feed today doesn't guarantee its continuity. Smart contracts should address this issue.

## Vulnerability Detail
Call to latestRoundData could potentially revert and make it impossible to query any prices. Feeds cannot be changed after they are configured (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-alchemix/blob/main/v2-foundry/src/utils/collectors/OptimismRewardCollector.sol#L33-L34) so this would result in a permanent denial of service.
## Impact
If the latestRoundData calls start to revert, the getExpectedExchange will not work and the protocol will be stuck in a state where it cannot get the price. Which will impact the RewardRouter contract and it will not be able to distribute the rewards. 
## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function getExpectedExchange(address yieldToken) external view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 expectedExchange;
        address[] memory token = new address[](1);
        uint256 totalToSwap = TokenUtils.safeBalanceOf(rewardToken, address(this));

        // Ensure that round is complete, otherwise price is stale.
        (
            uint80 roundID,
            int256 opToUsd,
            ,
            uint256 updateTime,
            uint80 answeredInRound
        ) = IChainlinkOracle(opToUsdOracle).latestRoundData();
        
        require(
            opToUsd > 0, 
            "Chainlink Malfunction"
        );

        if( updateTime < block.timestamp - 1200 seconds ) {
            revert("Chainlink Malfunction");
        }

        // Ensure that round is complete, otherwise price is stale.
        (
            uint80 roundIDEth,
            int256 ethToUsd,
            ,
            uint256 updateTimeEth,
            uint80 answeredInRoundEth
        ) = IChainlinkOracle(ethToUsdOracle).latestRoundData();
        
        require(
            ethToUsd > 0, 
            "Chainlink Malfunction"
        );

        if( updateTimeEth < block.timestamp - 1200 seconds ) {
            revert("Chainlink Malfunction");
        }

        // Find expected amount out before calling harvest
        if (debtToken == alUsdOptimism) {
            expectedExchange = totalToSwap * uint(opToUsd) / 1e8;
        } else if (debtToken == alEthOptimism) {
            expectedExchange = totalToSwap * uint(uint(opToUsd)) / uint(ethToUsd);
        } else {
            revert IllegalState("Invalid debt token");
        }

        return expectedExchange;
    }
```

```solidity
function distributeRewards(address vault) external returns (uint256) {

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Surround the call to latestRoundData() with try/catch instead of calling it directly. In a scenario where the call reverts, the catch block can be used to call a fallback oracle or handle the error in any other suitable way.
